black god's stoneenglish poemsutrykt manuskript








at the bottom



nobody knows what he wants -

the good are timid -,

the strong are devils -,

the wise are barren -,

the fertile seduced

to geld their fruits -

- where are you,

where are you tenderness, certainty -?

where

are you hiding -,

where do you hide -,

in readiness for

us who don't know what we seek -?


sleeping murmur



dark bosom of mine -

god has taken his seat

in my dark bosom -

o world, let god live -

o world -



the voice, against which

I always have to listen,

the voice is telling me, incessantly

that a world of burning secrets

is to find

there

there in the deep, where

god has pleased to crouch

in the soft silence

of life -







people of the world,

I want to death, that

you should long towards

the dark spreading deep,

towards the dark unknown soil

in the bosom of mine -

people of the world,

go and tell me,

what is in the

dark unknown bosom of mine -



god is nourishing on

my joy and my sorrow -

people of the world,

I beseech you, give

to me an eternal life -!

people of the world,

let god live -!

people of the world,

forget yourself, and give

your children to drink the milk of the sun,

the innumerable secrets

of the fire, and god's heart

of lust -



people of the world -!

go and tell me,

what is in the

dark bosom of mine -

forget yourself and

give to your children

thefulfilling,

eternally waiting deep, where

god crouches in

waiting silence of life -






the special miracle



every night he was tired,

and every day he did as he was told -

and without alarm

he grew thirty years old -

and rather alone -



then one night he was not sleepy,

and that night he thought,

that something

might happen to him -

especially -



and early in the morning

he stole five pounds,

and got together with a woman, he knew,

rather drunk -

the day, the night and the next day -



and late in the evening

he got caught -

quietly, without alarm -

and after a time came back -

but oh -!



every night he slept,

and by day he did as he was told -

and together with the woman, he knew,

he quietly grew sixty

years old -

when speaking of life,

he smiled -


the song of the useless



no wine don't help

nothing -

we have tried that too -







its gentleness is not

cruel enough -

there is nothing untried

to us -

don't wait

for notcoming cure -!

rather take all your

defects and hold forth

as ugly and

disgusting, as you ever can -,

the quite whole of

your scanty defects -

perhaps it'll help -

no wine in the world

really don't help

nothing -



we are quite a lot of us,

we will go all over the world

carrying an enormous banner

of disgusting rottenness

with us - who can tell,

perhaps it'll help -

we are quite a lot -

and no wine

will never help -

what we

have got, is not very enticing -

don't hide it away -!

do show it

high over the world

as a banner of future,

mightier than

oppressive beauty -!

perhaps it shall

be able

to kill all lying happiness

with sound disgust -






the castle



the eyes of my longing have grown impatient -

my longing claims irresistably

its fulfilling -

and me, the waiting dreamer,

she has forced to work -



my longing has declared everyone her enemy -

the burning swords of the sun

have become her slaves -

the silent cows of the moon

have become her slaves too -

irresistable my longing

has declared everything her enemy -

and of me, the patient lover of glory,

she has made a slave -



between the two rivers,

all around

the free country of my glory

is being raised a towering castle,

and no light nor sound

is to be let in -

I, the idling waster of happiness,

have been made a slave -

towards heaven

the castle is rising -,

in the dirt is bent the face of my glory -

towards heaven the walls are rising -

impregnable the walls

of my prison are rising -

in the tower am I -

no light nor sound

from my glory is let in -



my longing has grown impatient,

my longing claims its fulfilling -

in the tower she is coming to see me -

- she claims, what is hers -






the artist's vision




I know

everything -

I have payed

everything -




there is no

heart -

there is no

sun -

there is no

life -



there is

the god of hardness -

there is

the goddess of stone -

there is

the ice of my will -


wind



my love is the merciless killer -

my love is sailing in blood -

my love can only subdue -

my love can't like the subdued -

my love doesn't want no more blood -



on the rock

the far-off eyes of the albatross

is waiting -

the reef

is not the last -

the goal is one only -

that is

what the wind must bring -

soon -

the wind only

is eternal -






portrait



when sleeping

I seek my princess -,



in the morning

I break all the flowers -,



in the sun

I build my aloneness -,



towards night

I carve out the future -,



my life I spare -

my death

shall never exist -


the god of the blood(1 song)



I have given over

the gods of 1935 -

I have given over

the god of pleasure

with thegildedhands

and the green face -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have given over

the god of comfort

with the murmuring anxiety

and the rotten love-hands -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have known

the god of the bread,

the blind warrior -







he gave the bread

and the hunger for bread,

he said: "I know you not" -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -

I have fought

the god of happiness,

the soft-shouldered -

he gave what he had,

but he died on my sword -

he whispered: "I hate you" -

- I have gone

to the god of the blood -!

he gave me nothing -,

he said: "I have but

the cruelty which is truth -,

I have but the aloneness,

which is the way -,

I have but the place,

where to wait

with ice on your life -,

myhand is no giver -,

myhand is the unbroken law -.

I am the god of the blood" -

- I have gone -,

and my lips are locked -

l have gone -,

I have touched the flame,

which leaves no ashes

and no love to man nor woman -


the god of the blood(2 song)




the old gods are dead,

the old humanities are dead -

the old priests are liars -








the women of the old

are wicked with no soul in their blood -,

the men of the old

are beggars with no will in their blood -

the white blood of the old

is the world's poison

and the dragon before the world's treasures -



I am alone,

I have found no mate,

I am a half,

I am proud,

but I am nothing yet,

l obey and I wait,

and I hide my sword -



I know, the god of goodness

is dead -,

died in his own onliness -

his timidity devoured him

unborn -

I know, the god of goodness

has nothing left -,

owns nothing himself -,

has nothing to give -



I know, the goddess of love

is mouldering away,

withering deep in her own barrenness -

her wine was a sterile fire,

her goldenness an evil shade -

I know, the impoverished goddess of love

has nothing left -

her withered limbs have no heat left

to warm her age -

she has nothing to give -









you dark god

behind -, underneath -!

you severe god,

with black face

and the blood-red hands

and the silent eyes

and the streaming, unhearable voice -,

you dark god,

who was always behind,

you who held forth the others,

the weak ones, the pale and the powerless,

which are now dead,

you dark god,

who was always behind,

you who exerts your power without man's devotion,

you who knows our names,

which we cannot see ourselves -,

show us your face -!

kill the dying powerless gods

from the lost humanities -,

do free us from the nonpotent ashes

of bewildered man -!



in the cleaving paws of the night,

on the white at the bottom of the blood-proud sun,

behind the potent helmet of the gathering moon

I hear the voice -, streaming -

I hear,

and I obey -



but your name,

I want your face,

you with the two streams of life

in your right hand -

and the two black feathers of death

in your left hand,

I want your face,

your name -!








you, the only god -,

you, who was always behind,

underneath -, you who let die

the revengeful jehovah and the allforgiving christ,

you, who has destroyed the joyous realm of mammon,

stand out,

show us your hands -!

we are waiting -,

to obey -

we know, we are nothing apart from you,

give us back the old faculties

from before the reign of man,

give us back our righteous names -,

and our righteous piaces,

give to our men the will towards you,

which is all will,

and the only -,

give to our women the longing for you,

which is all longing -,

and the only -

give to the earth

and the sun and moon

the proportion which is you,

and you only -

we claim everything from you,

we have robbed ourselves of everything -!



o, we know that happiness is not in

youreye,

we know that blessed love is not in

yourcrown -,

we have caught your streaming voice

from far-off -!

we wantyoursway upon our blood,

we wantreality, which is you,

we want the right,

not love nor joy,

youare our want,








youto come inourhands, our eyes,

youto wander, swaying, throughourveins -

we know you,

o, we know you,

you black god of rightness -,

do crush our earth between

the fingers of your right hand -,

let come forth the marrow of our ill-used earth,

still waiting -

we, the last men and women of this earth,

we beg you to take our nakedness and

rule us again -!

o, black god, we beg you to give us back your severity

over our crippled blood,

we beg of you, o god,

nothing but the sight of your two hands -,

the two streams of life

and the black feathers of death,

we want your sword to wander among us

as before the reign of man -



we men of god,

we won't be reigned by anointedmen,

we, the men of god,

we want back our righteous chief -

- the men of god do wantyou

god -!


the mother's death




my mother parted

the string of the universe from me,

bearing me a closed person,

but she left the string

of intention, her person's pride -



with the string

of herwombround my neck








I went,

would create the growth of the star

with my young man's fingers -

round my neck the intention

of person -



I ran to my woman,

I pulled at the string unknowingly

with my young blood -

I ran to my woman,

the string of the unfreed flesh

round my blood -



I would give the star

with my soul,

and I wanted my body

to be given me -

my poverty

the poverty of the unborn -



I parted my blood

from my flesh and I ran

to my woman -

I gave with my soul,

and I stole with my flesh,

and my blood was behind

silent -



I tore the soul of my woman,

I gave her my soul away

and failed -

and wept, the string

round my neck, proud

as ice -




I have killed my mother -

I hear the stream -, the ice

is thrown over -








I am black as blood,

I am silent as

sun and moon together,

my voice swept away with the broken ice -



I hear the stream of creation,

not mine, not yours, not hers -

I have killed my mother -

my soul stands upright in the flood

like anotterodder -

the star is soft as silver

down in the flood -



my face is finished,

and the tree of sleep

is waiting -

the stream is silent -

my tongue stands vibrating

in the dead heart

of the angry intentions of

all persons -



the stream of creation

is climbing onunheedingpaws

towards me -

my face is closed round itself

like the jaws of life -


moon behind clouds



find your god,

or you can't live -!

the gods are waiting

motionless inflexible -

the black god

of the eagle is standing,

his dark, closed face turned away,

waiting -







the red god of the snake,

coiling with locked lips,

ready, ready -

the green god

of the grass with

silent blades,

awake, awake -

the unseen god,

watching for the blood to walk,

claiming, claiming -

find your god -,

or you can't live -!



you may worship the pale breed

of the selves -,

pace, begging, towards the smiling

woman o f death -

- the gods

are waiting,

waiting -!


rejected



sadness is

in my veins,

anger has filled my eyes,

my lips are dry with ashes -



my goodwill has turned to hatred,

my hope is an unworthy slave,

but my sight is clean as a spear,

and I see,

and I know,

o, I know,

the people of mine has refused

myservice -!







the people of mine

is happy -

but its prayers

are humble -

the world won't give

my people more money -!

the women can't give

the men no more pride -!

my people is happy -,

but my people is praying -



my people is licking its own holy corpse,

is biting in worship and hopeful resentment

the sacred parts -,

my countrymen don't like their devoted servant,

they cry -:

who are you,

to profaneourcandid devotion,

who areyou,

to call down the anger

of god 'pon the heads of your worshipping people -!



- my lips are dry with ashes -

I know why -


modest love-tune



ah -, I've found something -!

ah -, I love my flesh and my bones -

and my sweat and my marrow bones -

my body does give

me, what I want -,

my body denies me,

what I shouldn't want -



my body is no female body,

my body is not a price

to be paid for anything -







my body is no worker,

my body isn't no handle

of any machine -

and not the servant

of any prayer -

my body is me,

ah -, I love you, my shoulders, my knees -!



I do feel well

inyourcompany -,

you can't be flattered,

it is done -,

I can't be touched,

when I am with you -,

I'm glad, I've caught you at last,

you-,

me -!


good-bye




you are my friend -, but

don't let yourself be fooled

by the fair skin on my face,

don't believe

in the sky-blue ring round my pupils -



my friend -, yes -,

but you shouldn't

trust me that

open way of yours with the sad, kind smile -,

one day -, my friend,

you shall not know me,

one day you shall not know

me,

the born hater of what you love -



my friend -, with the outstretched hands,

my friend,








do turn your eye away

frommyhand,

always waiting, always awake -

my friend,

you know me not,

you have never seen me,

don't call me your friend,

I amnone,

can't be,

I hate you,

I must -,

turn away your eye -!

from me -



my friend -,

go -!

be aware -:

mysoul is not light

as yours -,

myblood is not

like the petals of roses -,

like yours -

the gloomy red of the sudden night,

that'smysoul -

the darting black on the puma's flank

does crouch inmyveins,

the inflexible jet on the stone of death,

that'smyblood -



my friend be aware -!

you must -

you are my enemy,

I can never know you -

my eyes despise

yourwomen -

my brow despises

yourclamorous love -,

youlaugh








atmysharpened silence -

- your garden, young man,

is filled with flowers,

the songs from your lips

are cunning, and the buds

will open -,

but your sight shall for ever

be hazy from love -, and never you shall know,

from what soil your songs did rise -



young man,

I must leave you,

for ever your people should mistrust me,

for ever, at your side,

I should be a stranger in every country -,

never

amongst your people I would find my righteous mate -




young man,

I must leave you -

mygathering race

shall never be strong

at peace withyours-

- the world was conquered by the pale-blooded -,

for centuries my race has been slaving -

but the slaves begot kings,

and the kings did slave, and their children,

for centuries -

the pale people forgot the law of their own gods -

they have lost the secret,

that gave the world to their sway -

the people of the pale has lost their hands -



but the god of my race has returned

from the bath of death -

- good-bye -!

I hear the call -








- the god of silence

with the will of the sun on his brow

has sent the spear of war

to me

his man -


in the glade



my fate

has no shadows

no home

and no friendly lake -

no whispering trees

and no female moon -

my fate

has no poems

no caressing fire,

and my way has

no polished end at last -

- you think

me the waiting poet -

I am not -



my fate shall not change -

I shall never

control my hissing voice -

I shall

never bring to my people

tied-up the broad-scaled fish of wisdom -

my people

shall never lift from my hands

the glowing gifts of my god -

never shall I leave the forests,

my fate shall never roar from the lustrious spires

of clearness -

my fate shall not change -







I am the dark-faced hunter,

I am hunting the arrows

from the unseen suns -,

I am hunting the coiling cues

from the waiting earth -

I throw my prey on the waters -

for the sharp-eyed to catch,

for the able to sow -

don't send your beggars to me -,

my mercy is gone -

don't send your rulers to me -,

my humbleness is gone -

if they come, the begging rulers,

I'll take them to the Stone in the glade

and betray them there -

if my fettered brothers

do seek me deep in the forest,

I'll show them

the craving of their re-born God -,

I will lend them

my eye and my spear -



but my dearest prey

I have thrown on the waters,

to feed my children -

I am the dark-faced hunter,

I throw my gold on the waters -


the thief



brother -,

the pale-dim love,

who comes to you,

when luxuriously you are spread

behind the dark-blue shield of your sleep -,

do drive her away -!







she is the queen of the pale-blooded king,

she has come,

to steal your proudest weapon -

do

drive her away -!

she has come

to empty your purpie quiver,

and give you in

her pale-blooded poison -

do drive her away -!



brother -,

if you open your lids

to her pale-dim beauty,

your eyes shall

be filled with the treacherous fog

from her glimmering womb -

do drive her away -!

when she comes through

the yielding night,

and pushes away your shield -,

remember her husband,

the king of

the slave-flogging fools -!



when she comes,

o, brother -,

her eyes will be white -

o, brother -,

do never forget

your own firm-bodied giver of pride,

your own slaving princess

of your own royal race,

though slaving to-day -!



don't forget, dearest brother -,

the power in the dark-blue shield,

given you by the bright-glowing day







of your own royal people -,

though slaving they are

to-day -!



don't forget, when she comes,

the pale-dim beguiler,

the infallible judgement

from your own royal blood,

remember

the unseen sun -!

o, brother -


to my woman



don't speak to me yet -,

I can't listen -

don't look at me yet -,

I can't meet you -

you who have the right

don't touch me -

yet my skin is not bright -



I

have no right yet -,

I

am not allowed yet

to take my right -

I have liked

thepale-browedwomen of the enemy -

don't claim no tenderness

from me -

I gave it to them,

that was all they could take -

don't claim no strenght

from me -

that was what they wanted -







don't mention to me

my name -

don't mention to me

myrighteouspower -

- o, wait -!

I can't meet you yet -

the will of my blood

has returned to the lake of our dead,

to wash from its heart the pale-blooded hatred -

- o, wait -!

I can't meet you yet -

whisper



pale-brown girl,

I want to touch your hand,

your slim, patient hand -,

I want to touch your fingers -,

to watch your pale-brown face

turn -



my heart is a knot

of ill-treated scars

in my tight-screwed fist -

pale-brown girl,

I am afraid of every movement -

your soft, black eyes

do graze my brow -

will you heal me -?

can you -?



pale-brown girl,

I want to touch your fingers -

I am afraid of every movement -

let your sad, black eyes

rest on my brow -

I have no tears,

and my strength has gone -






to my dancing-partner



we are

the real action,

we are

together,

we are

the Dance -



you are

my perfect instrument,

I am

your perfect voice,

we play what we

do know,

we are

the instrument to play

what there is to know -



I love

your heart in my bow -

you love

my blood in your song -

together

we carve out a star -,

together

we make a new life -

we are

the real action,

we are

the Dance -


verse



I wanted to love,

rage came to me -

I wanted to hate,

everything weakened -







I wanted to leave,

there came

a sad-eyed girl, she took my hand,

I slept -

I have not risen -


the song of the lonesome warrior



-man

is the one action -

-man

is the only real -

-man

is the world to come -



the earth

must be loved bymen-

the wretched parts

of the futile will to be men

is stabbing

the patient heart of the earth,

crying :

"behold,we

have subdued this lazy servant -,

soon she will love us -"



soon she will die -

the last of her voice

are the remnants of man -

the earth

must be loved bymen-,

not by waiters,

and buyers

and sellers -

no part can love -,

- onlymancan love -

- you mourning remnants,

- awake -!







the reign of the seekers

is finished -

-man

is the only real -

-man

is the world to come -


the voice of the man



don't seek my eyes -

I am afraid of every contact -

I am afraid

of the desire to rule

deep in the soul of my hand -

I am afraid of the fetters,

which my eyes do put on everything -

don't touch me -,

I hate obeyance -,

I hate the clinging love of the dreamers

don't seek my eyes -,

I am no phantom -,

I am no seeker -

don't touch me -



I am nothing but fate -

I am afraid of every contact -

my hand shall take what it must -

don't touch me -

my eyes don't seek -


now I know you



now

I know you -

you have betrayed me -

your arms were warm







but your heart was white

and poor as steel -



now

I know you -

you have used me -

you wanted to sell

my will -

but do know -:

your prey shall be

the snake of my

righteous anger -,

when your feet will turn

down the path towards the market

of my enemies,

you'll have but the poverty

of yourself to sell -



do know -:

your own people you can't deceive -,

they

know your want,theyfeel

your naked soul in their hands -



now

I know you -

when smiling

into my enemies' faces,

your prey

shall be the unstained dagger

of the upright purity which you

could not love,

when you feel

the coins of your price

in the hands of your cunning,

in that moment, betrayer,

you'll have upon

your adorable neck the rising power,







you couldn't conquer -

you'll know,

that offering lips can be wounded,

the law

of the blood has never

been broken -



I know you -

be safe -,

youhave nothing to lose -

you

have betrayed,

but the will

you could rob of nothing -


the smile



you old woman

with the cutting sparks

behind the slow glance -,

with lips as a slash in a lonely fir -,

with teeth as lurking anger -,

ah you -!

ah you -, you -!



I'll drive you

slowly, slowly towards the immovable precipice -,

I'll laugh at your sneering retreat -,

I'll snap at your lingering heel,

you wicked love-hater -,

I'll crush your sunken bosom,

and

on the outmost brink

I'll bite your murderous joy,

I'll love you to ripeness hard as flint -,

you -, ah

you -, dear -!






my prayer



o god -,

o god -,

my sight will turn hazy -!



the limping,

out-reaching fear

does break the purity

of creative rhythm -,

the worshipping falsity

of hopeless fear

does lock the ears

to the resounding power

of creative pride -



god, give me

the forcing translation

of the urge in the storm,

of the voice in the rising sun -,

give me

the binding power,

that ropes-in the many,

that forces the frightened

into the rhythm

of creative will -



god, show me

the name of my mate,

the only -,

that, like a column of blood, my tree

may stand out -

god,

this is my prayer -


proposal



this is me -

this is, what I

demand







from the mate,

which is to be mine -:



when she is near me,

we shall be born from god -,

when I am with her,

we shall beget the prince,

for whom the world is waiting -



when I leave her,

to risk my life with my icy fate,

her pride shall conquer

easily her womb -



when I beg her to heal

my tired-to-death despair,

she,

with steel-hard courage,

shall show me again and again

the way which may hold out

the destruction of me,

her man -

her eye

shall be the merciless

killer of my will to die -

her foot

shall be the burning sceptre

to my victorious joy -

her life

shall be the voice

of my blood -

I shall call her

my woman -


hunting-song




I am no human -

the pace of my blood

is alien to all that is human -








I despise the ready-made limits and

the mercy from fear,

I hate themoulderingseparatenes

and thegeldedmass-will

of the human -



I am no human -

I adore my forcing desire

to destroy the want to build monuments

to strangle the insane need to rule

the detestable lust ofsubmission,

to stab the hateful want

to glorify all dying -



I am no human -

I am blind to

the greatness of mankind

except the black nerve

deep through the flesh of all living -

I have no faith

in the future of mankind

except in

the burning rhythm

quiveringmerciless

through the will of all living -



I am no human -

my cat-soft soul

is always on guard to shun

the track of all human -

the scent of my blood

is hostile to all that is human -

but -, alas -, I love

the dance in every foot of life,

o, I love

the song in the eyes of every fire,

and -, alas -, I can't but

bow in the dust








to each hand of creation

and everywombof love -




I am no human -

the raving dread

of all that is human

had driven me

step by step

deep into the forests of hatred -

but now I have triumphed -,

my voice has forgotten all words -,

my love

has made the forests my home -

I have found the fire

of my own rock -,

I have acknowledged

my seed of future -

at last -


brother -!



don't fight

your own silent will -

don't build barriers

on the only way of your soul -



nothing there is

to change -

everything is,

bright behind the shabby clothes

of the un-real -



nothing there is

to change -

everything is,

waiting, ready

to stand out







free and strong

to its own brightness -



don't fight

your own silent will -

stand out

naked to your own soul -

pull off

the contaminated rags

of imperious death-will -,

leave behind you

the strangling chain of the dread

of life uncovered -



do walk

silent the way of your deepest being -

nothing there is

to change -

the will

of the sun and the unconquerable blood

is you too -


the message of the chief



when you open

towards night or day

the shield-like tent-door

of your fate, calling:

I am this, I am that,

my need is all or nothing

or -:

mypride is not dependant

on neither joy nor shelter -!

when calling

towards night or day,

don't think you are god,

don't expect

your voice to fill







the gaping cup of your life -!

you are calling -,

that's all -

the answer is not

from you -



do close

tight the protective door

of your life-tent -

don't whisper,

in claiming rage:

I am this, I am that,

myneed is the need of a king

or that of a slave -!

the answer is not

from you -



do close

tight the saving door

of your life-tent -

do keep holy

the untranslatable sign of your blood

on the brow of yours -

do preserve

as your only treasure

the waiting silence

of your upright will -



don't send

your claiming calls

towards night nor day -

the answer

will come -


a tale about love



there is the rock -

and the steel-bright, averted face -

but there is







the little door too -

and there is

my blood-red heart

burning on its golden foot -



but you

knock at the stone,

and you

promise to wait one hundred years

for the eyes to turn -

and you

cry your life to rags

because my heart

is a flame on its golden foot -



there was the rock -

and the closed, blind face -

but there was

the little door too -

and you

are nothing to me -


the certainty



the radiant outskirts

of the land which is real

gleam forth -

in the land which is real

I have my friend -

there we shall touch

the simple nakedness

of each other -,

my friend and I -



four is the sacred number

in the land which is real -

my friend and his woman,

I and my woman,







in the holy grove

there are the four trees

of our common silence -



I have caught a glimpse

of the land which is real -

nothing

shall turn my pace -


the ruler



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

my wealth has no limits -,

and my cruelty neither -

nothing can hinder

the growth of my power -,

not even the steel-hard grasp

of my dark-blue hand

can direct

the fall of corroding drops

from my jet-black star -

I am the ruler -

but the unchecked growth of my power

is threatening even the ground

of the deep-bolted f eet of my soul -



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

but my eyes are tired

of condemning

what has always been dead -,

and my eyes can't like

what they themselves have created -

I am the ruler -

but my neck is tired

of its own inflexible pride -

my heart of blood

is tired of kissing what it has born itself -







I am the ruler -

but I say -:

I would break my unshaken crown

to get love

not created by me -,

I would give my invincible power

to get love,

whose fire could feed itself -



I am the ruler

of all inescapable love -

I want to be robbed of my riches -,

I am tired of giving

my presents of fate -

I am the ruler -

I want my strength to forsake me -,

and my lust of creation -

there is too much blood in my eyes -,

and too much murdering purity

has left my hand already -



I am the ruler -

but my crown is stronger than I -

I am the ruler -

but my power has beaten my will -

the ring of my crown is unbroken -


the gull



- this rock

is my place -

my eyes

are setting off on low wings

from this rock -

- this sea

is my life -

my eyes

are hovering on motionless wings

over this sea -







- my eyes

can grip only the far-off -

my eyes know no short distances -

- my eyes

have no colour to change -

my eyes are indifference to everything -

my eyes remember nothing but their unseen aim -

- my eyes

don't wait for anybody to rise -

my eyes know their place and their life -:

this rock -

this sea -

- everything else is dead unto my eyes -


the stone



all, I give respect,

in my self,

I have cut off

from my life -



all, I have loved,

in my eyes -,

in my heart -,

in my hands -,

I have cut off from my life -



all, that was creative

and strong in my blood,

I have locked up

in this unhewn stone -

all, that was generous

and soft in my blood,

I have locked up

in this stone on the shore -



all, I have won

by now,







is the undeceivable contempt,

which from now on

shall be my soul

and the only guard

of the key to this stone -



but always

the key will be ready -!

thence the holiness of my pride -,

thence the joy in my smile of anger -,

thence

all the unworthy remains,

I have given my idleness to play with -


my evening has come



here I sit -

looking into my flickering fire

before me -

outside the tent

my enemies are whispering

to each other -

I was the victor always -

I could never be conquered -

they could not touch me -



here I sit -

the all-embracing serenity

on me -

always my deepest desire

was fulfilled -

my success is still as clean, as new ice -

I was always able to take

my soul's want -

I was able

to make of my self what I wanted -,

what I must -







I could never be conquered -

I was always the victor -

here I sit -

with my legs crossed, looking

with far-off eyes into my own fire -

outside the tent

the hatred goes on whispering -

to night I shall be murdered -

I -, the victor -,

I who couldn't be conquered -

my unpierceable quietude embraces everything

like the first mother -

here I sit -

with my tent around me -

my evening has come -


hymn



the house of my certainty

is so vast

that I never can touch its walls -



the room of my deepest desire

is so sacred

that none but my friend and my woman

can be permitted to enter -



the tower of my watchman's eye

is so high

that the fall of my death

never can reach

the aim of my fear -



the sword of my pride

is so hard

that never the corroding impurity

assembled from all the world

can stain its brightness -







to every upright soul in distress

the house of my certainty

is open -

to every fighting will of blood

my gleaming eye

is the unfailing sign of victory,

of inexhaustible rest -

to every succumbing purity

the garden of my healing love

is prepared

with unvanquished tenderness -



the house of my certainty

is nobody's property -

I

am the ever-watching opener

of its silent gate -


melody



she came to me

with flashing eyes

and thrown-back hair

commanding -:

I am the princess -



I made her

the begging fire

the kneeling eye

whispering -:

you are my ruler -



she left me

with silent eyes

and inflexible brow

to wander

the painful way of a princess -






slave -!



your murmuring soul

calls me

the snake-man and the whip of cruelty -,

your sneering lips

are chewing

the fettered shouts:

tormenter on his self-made throne of haughtiness -,

oppresser with his lifted spear

of un-sharpened death -!



the film of your sight

is the skin of the slave

which is you -



tenderness is weeping

deep in my soul, unused -,

but not for you -

hungering love is awake

for ever in the veins of my covered limbs -,

but not for you -



your race, it is,

who makes me

an imprisoned ruler

and blackens the naked face

of my glory of life -

your race, it is,

who forces me

to make a merciless sword

of my free-born soul -

your race, it is,

slave -

- the hating barrenness

behind the eyelids of yours and your numerous breed

is distasteful to me -

do

leave me alone -






the foreboding



the glowing stone of nobility

is the eye -

through the jet-bright gate

of the eye goes

the irresistible stream

of the male-ruler's straight command -,

piercing merciless

the shells of poisoned resistance -

through the soft-opening mouth

of the eye does

the forcing-creative stream of submission

penetrate unheeding -

the new nobility,

which is to save the world's

heart and womb

to man,

is older than the died-away

nobility that failed -

the new nobility

must have

both the black blood-silent origin and

the tenderly redeeming future

in its eye -,

the glowing stone of all nobility -


the song of the black banner



try not

to rebuild the white-soaring swan

of freedom

of equality

on the soil of snapping dogs -

she'll be

the easy prey to their

dripping hunger -,

the sneaking bitches

and the cringing dogs -







there is no freedom

there is no equality

not too

frail, not to crumble

beneath their stinking love

and their rat-like joy -,

the dogs -



there is one freedom

there is one equality

one only -:

the icy loneliness of the sailing eagle

the meeting bitterness of the real lovers

the forcéd closedness of the god-born ruler -

there is one freedom

there is one equality

one only -:

the silent community

of the aristocrats of the Blood -

there is one sign of freedom

and one sign of equality

one only -:

the irresistible voice

from the god-eye of Blood

on the purified brow of its man -


spring ballad



I am the proudest of thieves -

with a golden ring round my hair

I sett off, when the sun sets,

to steal all I want -

my gliding pace

is in itself the mocking unhearable fanfare

of my dangerous night -



I am the proudest of thieves -

I despise all work,







I scorn all toiling for money and food -

I can love only

the darting strength in my limbs,

the unbroken growth of my beauty -



with a golden ring round my hair

I set off, when the sun sets,

to steal what the ugly have worked -

and with stolen garments

on my wonderful shoulders,

when the sun just rises,

I break the door of my sweet-heart -



and in naked pride of my own,

when the sun is treading

on the working backs of the ugly,

I throw to my sweet-heart

the gleaming prey of the night -

and she smiles like the queen of queens -,

she is a grand thief too,

the magnificent vanity

which my sweet-heart is -



I am the proudest of thieves -

when the sun roars its day-song,

my hair will sparkle like stolen diamonds

over the world of bent backs -

when the sun is singing and the day is high,

my wonderful love is my own -


a little song



I have killed mary ann's god -

mary ann dreads my god -

I love mary ann -

when the burning blackness stands out before me,

I leave mary ann

to her love of me -







when the pale sun rises

with its blue morning-wet eyes,

I return to mary ann

with my love of her -

poor mary ann -

and poor me -

but we have a great heart

together -

mary ann and I -


to the earth



now, mother -,

I have covered my face into yourbosom-

now, mother -,

I can have rest a short time, completely -

now, mother -,

my eyes are closed upon yours, closed too -



mother -,

you gave me the power of giving the comfort

which alone isnourishingand bright -

but, mother -,

I would only once give, what you have given me,

and not being forced to take back my gifts ashitherto

for the sake of your purity -, my mother -



but now,

mother -,

my eyes are closed upon yours, closed too -

now, mother -,

I can have rest a short time, completely -


the ring



I have broken the floor

of my loneliness -







I dig the claws of my soul

deep into the rock -

downwards, downwards -



the rock of darkness

has devoured me -

all directions

but one are torn asunder -

downwards, downwards -!



I have broken the floor

of my loneliness -

softly, softly

I sink through the mountains

of blindness -



soon

I shall eat the scent

of the hearts of my brothers -

soon my drop

can't be distinguished

from those of my brothers -

soon the river

will close the ring of future -


the dawn is grey over the sea



my race is as old

as the earth,

and my race is as rich -

but I

was born young,

my parents I couldn't find

and my kingdom neither -

my servants will not obey me,

and the women around me I scorn -







am I the last

cry of a drowning wave,

or am I the fresh-born foam

of the first approaching breakers

along an unknown shore -?



the patience of my pride

has no limits -

but the eye of my maledom

is blind -


to the body of my music



you speechless, useless

thing,

which alone, in spite of all,

I can love -,

what are you

really -?

are you just a trumpet,

you thing of my love -?

are you just atalon,

you beloved thing of my anger -?

or just an unused knife,

you beloved thing of my pride -?

what are you,

are you anything

real at all -?

come on,

you speechless, useless thing,

come on,

you which alone, in spite of all,

I can love -,

let us blow in your stupid trumpet,

let us tear with those insane talons,

let us use, then, this unused knife -,

come on, you -,

help me







to destroy

this human heart ofbarrenness

loiteringthrough all time

in this wonderful piece

of nature -,

come on now,

you -,

whatever you may be then

really -!


god of all nature



god of all nature,

if you would take

me in your unseen hand

to be filled or to fill -!

god of all nature,

and you will

or you will not, and

I am still yours,

a foot in the dark,

god of all nature -


leaving



don't believe

one more word

from any lips -

all words are poisoned -

only believe

what your eyes will love,

and your fingers want to touch -

there is a great sleep

still rising in all nature -

seek your rest there -

then

your eyes can't be deceived,

then







your eyes shall know their love

and their enemy without question,

and your fingers shall unlock

never-opened doors,

which must be opened -

and then

your soul will have no more goals

and no more words wherewith

to build evil walls,

wherewith to make unclean arms -

there is still the great sleep waiting -


and now we'll say



and now we'll say this:

we want a new music

into this world -

and now we'll say it:

we want

a new music into this world -



still we are no niggers -,

because we laugh in angry pain

over this insane civilization -

and still we are no infants

any longer -,

only because we are still able to laugh our corroding anger

over this hateful civilization -

and now we'll say this:

we want a new music

into this world -

and we'll say this too:

we can't be soothed any more

with caresses from this world

and we shall not -,

until we have

got a new music

into this world -







and don't believe

that we might just be let to die

in peaceful starvation,

before having crushed forth

the new music of ours

into this world -!


my people



- my scattered people

is a people of haters -

and I believe

in its ragged banners

of blackness -,

loitering

like withheld storms

over this play-world

of frightened pity -

the sign of hatred

is the sign of

the will to die alive,

and not

dance in garments of love

the life of death -



- my scattered people

is the people of love -

but its lips

are denying,

and its eyes are contempt -

a people who see

is forced

to hate a world who's blind -



- my scattered people

is the people of love -

and its way

is the way of all haters -






warning



why do you return

to me -?

now there are no fetters left

for you to seek

and grasp and rule me by -

why do you return -?

all returning is wrong -

now I am a thousand times

more dangerous -

now all the dikes

are broken -

and the ways of my flood

are unknown even to my own

notcaring eye -

and now

all generosity of my heart

has gone,

and my old fountain

of tenderness is dry -

so why do you return -?

there is nothing left

in me of that,

which you care for -

there is only

a dark, stained will

of destruction left,

which I cannot guide

and am not willed to

any more -

so what do you return

for now -?

even my sight of you

is dim by now -

but come,

come -

what do I care -






blindness



I have built a great tower,

sort of enormous light-house

to my inner eye -

each stone above another

is a pride,

each stone above another

is another pride -

and each pride

is stronger and more hard

than the other -

the colour of each stone

is red from love -

never-sated love, sharp

like rubies -

the eye on top of the tower,

blind from mad pride,

is hunger,

hunger,

hunger -

lifted like a bright axe,

threatening the sun

and the sky,

a dry, mad eye,

more proud than the sun at noon

over a pale sea -


evening in the forest



only man has made himself

his god,

only the god, man, can become

old and die -

there are thousands of gods,

some of which we know

some of which we see only one time

some of which are but names -

- I am not old and I am not young,







I know only

the gods of growth and birth and death,

they don't speak to us, they

don't want our prayers, and

sometimes I've heard them laugh

and sometimes weep -

what do they

care about man and his angry claims,

they know but growth and birth and death

why should we claim to be men -?

- sometimes I hear my laughter answered,

and sometimes my sorrow -

there are thousands of gods,

some of which we know -


song of the council



the name of our

wisdom is wine and dance

and silence -

the name of the great hunger

is the same -

the goddess of wisdom

is always alone,

and always drunk

and always she feels

the far-off rhythm of the unknown

teasing her pride, binding

her tongue, releasing

the voices of her listening blood -

we'll protect her aloneness

and shield her silence,

her words do creep strange ways -


nights



there are nights when I know much -

when no stars venture to ascend

the black walls of pride -







when all the great cans are broken

without a sound -

when no timid heart can catch the tune

from the gates of orgy -

nights with no prices,

nights void of fear -



there are nights when I know much -

when the unseen rivers are felt

creeping blackly beneath my feet,

carrying silently the directions of the world's caravans -

nights when no man,

and no cry does mean much -

there are nights when the rivers show new ways of life,

only for the proud to use -

nights

for bursting wombs

to blossom,

for dying hearts

to kill -,

silent nights -,

nights for great tribes

to change their path for ever -,

for weapons never heard-of

to be seized by sleeping fingers -,

nights without speech -



nights when strings, rarely touched,

will disturb fate's sleep -,

nights from which

some men shall awake with new eyes

and few words left in their heart -


what is there



what is there

but eternal giving away

of yourself,







and eternal being born

anew to yourself -?

what is there

but millions of strange gods

in the sea, in the sun,

in the air,

gods and gods and gods,

dangerous and sometimes mild -?

what is there

but thousands of loves

in wombs, in hearts,

in the earth,

love and love and love,

murderous and sometimes like bread -?

what is there

but eternally being too weak

and eternally being stronger

than yourself -?


the song of my tribe



the men of my tribe

are mostly silent

and most of days

they go wandering

towards some unknown calling -



the men of my tribe

are mostly serious

and most of days

they go thinking

how far off the rest of their hearts do linger -



the men of my tribe

are mostly hungry

but on certain days

they sate their bodies

and souls in short joy -







the men of my tribe

are on the way towards the deserts

and the staring caves where life has hiddert,

to make their fires there -

the men of my tribe are mostly silent -


song



I have no need of women,

why should I

why should you -?

I have no need of men,

why should I

why should you -?

- sometimes I want to love,

then I set off

far away, or not far,

for where love is -

why should I

why should you -?

it is fine to seek what you want,

fine to wander far or not far,

to seek what you want,

it is fine to be always proud -

why should I

why should you -?


the time has come



the time has come,

when man shall no more

try to be anything

but man besides the rest which

is not us -

the time has come,

when the ruler shall

be a ruler only among the rulers,

when the lover shall be a lover







only among lovers,

the time has come,

when man shall have to

be himself only,

and be that

to the rest which is not him -


where is laughter -?



when I sing songs

to the Unknown which made me burn,

there is laughter in my heart -

when I dance the rhythm

of life in honour of the gods of Blood,

there is laughter hissing

somewhere -

when I pour my joy into some open womb

to feel breed of the Earth in my buttocks,

there is big laughter sending roots

into soil -

o where, where is laughter -?



to fight death like the men of my tribe

is to behold

armies of flaring laughters

between the world and

you always -

o where, where is laughter -?

to hunt death in silent anger

by day and by night

as the price of sleep,

is life -

o where, where is laughter -?


there's still riches



what do we care about anything

but the real thing -!

what are the systems of mankind to us -?







wewant the pearl that's cheap like grey stone,

the gust of wind, precious like our mother's heart -

o, no -!

there's still some cruel laughter bidden in our blood,

still rich.es clinging to our bare hands -

oh no - oh no -!

still we're too cautious

to put in our lot with mankind's -

o, no -!

the tribes don't speak each others' tongues,

why should they -!

oh -, our pride is still a good tent

'gainst mankind's dry winds -

isn't our laughter too sharp -?

oh yes - yes - it is -!

what dowecare about anything

but the real thing -?

what is the sick clamour of mankind to us -?

ifourdeath will visit us,

we'll receive her duly -

but mankind's -?

oh no, she has too easy wings -

o, no to us there's still riches waiting

on our bare, wet rocks -


the weapon



hunger has left me -

love has left me -

longing for events is not with me -

misfortune has found me out -



but joy cannot slay -,

and the love, you find, cannot slay -,

if I held a weapon, that

could hit by itself -!

but hunger has left me -

and love has left me -







no longing is with me now -

it must come by itself -

or stay away -

the green, the warm,

the weapon,

which need not hit -


hidden striving



there is silence in my world -

therefore I sing low songs through the nights -

the silence creeps mistlike,

eating my world -

the small things I know

will not answer

the great things I need -

the low songs of my faith

cannot stop

the bleeding of hunger's blood -

but the nights are innumerable -,

I'll work 'pon my tunes,

till they shine flickering,

hazy like old weapons -,

till they stand like pale noble cans

dripping with dangerous wine -

I shall sate silence,

night by night,

with exquisitely carved instruments, and pearls

beyond value -

- low songs creep mistlike,

seeking the faith of silence -


spring journey



- by night I left the world's house,

wandered deep into

myself,

leaving each door unclosed -







no stars were there, no sun, no moon,

I fought through barren wildernesses

with blindness lurking

on each step, with corroding poison

eating the sight of soul and body -

I went still deeper -,

I groped through rocky darkness

into utter void -

my eyes had died,

all sound had fled,

the soul shrank in dread, the last,

from nothingness -

- I staggered

deeper -

and from beyond despair

read with blinded eyes

the tale of man's spring -

carved in stone -

fuller and truer -

redeeming everything -

like a flower -


finished



no more havanas

no more dancing

and

no more happiness - no

happiness -

no more gold -

no gold, but

merciless

value - new

value -



no more madness -

no more barrenness -

and no more mercy -

- bread, children and







a new value to get light from

with no margin -

and no mercy -

a new scale

without mercy and

without escape -

not one -!

not THAT

any more

not once

more -

again -



now -

at last -

no more substitutes -

and no patience -

and no patience -

at last -

and no substitutes -

and

no

patience

any more -

it has grown

too late -

and there is

no holiday

left -



what is left for

you, you and you -

and you

is

thelast

the ultimate last

left opportunity

foreverything-







the new price,

or nothing -

the new

life or sterile death -

this minute and not tomorrow -

and no mercy -

and no kissing -

and

no escape -!







solen finnssvenska dikterutrykt manuskript








nyår(från danskan)



i årets gula blomma

över fjärran tusen vägar

lyser gammalt

slocknande tår -

högt högt längs spröda stänglar

droppar klängande

rinner mot oceanens glömska -

- när varenda tår har runnit,

skall jorden resa sig ur badet

med fasans dyning over sin skuldra

som en slaktad dumhet -

når obehövlighetens potta är full,

skall jorden vara utan minne

och med det väsentliga

som ett vulkaniskt utbrott på sin hjässa -

- i en avsides dal

skall ligga en vit sten

som sol -

och från den skall en sjuttonårig

tigga verklighetens droppe -


saga(till Harry Martinson)




vandrande dag efter dag

på vägen, som ständigt skiftande,

långsamt framåtskridande, leder

mot orätt viljas mål -,

där -, mot kväll

mötte jag henne, som ägde färmågan att förvandia allt -








med stumma, heligt rädda

ögon

stego vi hand vid hand

med ångestfull visdom i hjärtat

in i det grönblå dunklet

bredvid vägen -

och dånande

i det endas blindhet

slog vågen samman över oss -




törstande efter svalka

milströtta på vägen,

som ständigt skiftande -, långsamt framåtskridande,

leder mot inga viljors mål,

då

mot bräcklig morgon funno vi källan,

som ägde förmågan att giva svalka -

vid dess fot

byggde vi vårt hem -



över ingången skrev jag,

såsom jag hade lärt -:

"vägarna själva vandra -

moget och tungt blir hjärtat

av oförtjänta gåvor -

inget återkommer -

målet okänt är

ditt ödes amulett -,

osynlig, okuvlig om din hals -

nomad -, irrande,

trampar fram

det eviga hemmet -"


det susar i skogen(till Edith Södergran)



en droppe i skogen vill forma allt i sin bild -

en droppe i skogen

fann sig själv sannare än allt -







skogens droppe fattade lyran,

större än världen -:

detta endast är ett öde,

att finna sig själv skönast,

sannast,

renast -



allt vill jag forma i min bild -

allt skall

vara det härligaste av allt -

högre, högre hänger lyran,

större än världen -

darra, o värld, för ditt öde -



darra, o värld -

skapelsen kommer -

en droppe i skogen blev sannare än allt -


allt



längta bara ljuset,

dröm själva drömmen,

vänta dig blott hoppet,

älska sömnen, som gives dig,

därifrån du inget vet -


mänskoord



om liv att skänka

är din längtan,

tigg icke av ängen blommor,

av buskarna bär -

måla knoppar med ditt blod,

sätt dem på döda kvistar,

sov framtidens sömn -


drömmen



varför drömma löften om kärlek -,

kärlek är icke det första -,







det första tiger, avrundat och utan namn -,

det första är drömmen själv,

som maste drömmas, blomma och

mogna före allt annat -


morgon



varifrån kommer det,

att vi, utan allt,

fattiga på allt,

kunna drömma allt -?

- framtiden är redan lagd,

fjärran vilar hon

sövd av våra drömmar -


höst



rök silar ur min mun,

där det rätta är instängt -

sömn har blivit min lusta,

vinet min lampa -

ändå vet jag, att

det finns dans, som dansas

av fötter som måste,

att båtar kantra,

därför att löften lyste, som

kunde blivit sanna -

fast mina drömmar ha

dött utan mening, tror jag att hoppet

flämtar ännu

i öknar,

som ingen fot ännu vågat -


höst



jag ville,

att livet skulle vara en stark

röd älskog, iförd hårt lärft,







en rygg, som tålde att hatas,

en vilja till annat än smekning -

men det liv, jag fann,

var en ödmjuk,

bedjande rygg,

en gnista, som ömt måste skyddas,

ett hopp, för vilket varje åker var mager

och varje regn vinterns is -


jag önskar mig



okända ansikten,

att glödande känna igen -,

ett aldrig brukat leende,

att ta som en fågel mellan mina händer -,

en ny ström av blod,

att ha som ett spett

av järn för blodets strider -,

och stoltast

önskar jag mig den eviga vakan,

den inget undgår -


teckning



nej -,

min stora -,

grymma -,

alltförlåtande kärlek

får

inte blomma -

nej -,

- åh, varför -, varför -

nej -,

hon är så obeveklig

och stor -,

så löjlig

och grym - hon är

så ond,







hon förlåter

gränslöst

allt -,

jag befaller

henne att stanna,

där hon är -

hon får

inte

blomma -

jag måste

befalla

henne att stanna

där hon är -


kristall



sök icke dina drömmars mål,

dina drömmar äro oklara stenar -

mata din längtan med livets bittra vilja -,

tvinga dina drömmar mogna som

det röda törnets bär, att

plockas av vem som gitter

älska bara blod -

slipa din ångest, att hon blir

lik den skarpaste kniven, den alla längtar -


älska



älska ditt tecken

likt taggtråden, som skyddar

blodstridernas

ensamma ros -

göm ditt tecken

under en åls slemmiga rygg,

den ingen kan ta,

och ingen hålla fast,

så länge livet spänner

hans envist dansande skinn -







älska ditt tecken

likt taggtråden, som skyddar -,

kryp och göm dig,

hugg och bit,

åla dig hatande, att ingen snappar

dolda blodstriders

tecken på dig själv -


varför hindrar du



varför hindrar du mig,

varför måste du hata min grymhet,

varför klagar du, så att jag hör dig -?

de, som, kämpande, förtjänar mig,

har jag skänkt rätten att hoppas,

de, som lider, ocksåminaböner,

har rätt att hoppas

ur all min grymhet

droppen, som smälter -


ön



vi, som leva på denna ö,

ha fått nog utav hunger

och stormar -

vi, som leva på denna ö,

behöver du ej skänka hopp,

mer än de fattiga eldar, vi ha -,

vi, som leva på denna ö, känna

dina gåvor till grunden,

och vi, som leva på denna ö,

tro, att vi icke behöva

mera utav hunger

och stormar -,

vi tro säkert, att vi

ha fått nog utav dina gåvor -

vi, som leva på denna ö,

behöver du ej skänka hopp -






vaka



tänd inga bål på länge,

låt mörkret brinna ut,

flämtande och sent, som det vill,

tänd inga ljus, förrän

mörkret rodnande har brunnit ut -,

låt mörkret stråla sitt svarta ljus,

så länge oljan droppande kan brinna -,

tänd ingen eld, förrän allt

sover svart hungerns bidan -


någonvart



evinnerliga svultna revolutioner

vill jag kalla stigen, som

leder någonvart -

du, som hoppas och verkar,

att solen ska stanna i ett hål på himlen

eller på din gräsmatta utav

en viss anledning, dig

önskar jag omåttlig fetma

och gränslös lycka -

jag och världen hoppar,

evigt döende,

från barrikad till vanvett och

från mord på sällhet

till evinnerligt nya dödar, ständigt,

evinnerligt någonvart -


underbarare än regnbågen



mer underbar än regnbågen

är hungerns poesi,

drömmen att

med samma flottglänsande kniv

få utföra svältens slöjdans

och mättnadens vilda rumba,







den drömmen går före alla andra drömmar,

när du möter den -,

hungerns poesi är

modigare än alla drömmare, fräckare

än alla mördare -,

underbarare än regnbågen

är hon -


giv mig



giv mig korv, vin, ost -,

du ska få en aning

utav det,

som gör hungerns bädd

mjuk någon timme -

giv mig ett leende -,

och jag ska ge dig meningen

med leenden då vi båda

icke finns -


helgerån



dina händer tala ett annat språk

än din mun törs andas -

varför skämmas dina fingrar,

varför blicka dina ögon stolt

mot vad som bländar andra,

varför vågar du steget nu,

som skulle varit nätternas

pris åt dagen -,

hur vågar, leende, du

förringa framtidens mynt -?


tro



jag vill följa den eviga blindheten,

stolt vill jag kyssa hennes piska,

jag vill ödmjuka mina ögon till







hatets maskar på den blommande lågheten -,

jag vill blända min själ, att

hon må gå säkert -,

jag vill älska vad jag icke kan fatta,

och bekämpa allt gott,

om det finns ett hjärta,

måste jag hitta det då -


du tror



du tror att jag gömmer mina skatter

av hat,

du tror att jag lyder

min stolthed, när jag tiger,

att mitt rus är glädje -

- det finns dagar som sekunder -,

det finns dagar, som sparar

åt livet timmar av blod -


frukten



tungt andas kölden -

djupt, djupt sänder jag mina rötter -

- står luften ännu bunden vid horisonten,

sover solen ännu så fjärran,

att mina blommor måste längta mot rotens kyssar -,

sover solen ännu så fjärran, att

kölden inget har att frukta -?

- mina blommor börjar hata sin rot -


ångesten



dra dig undan ångestens

smala händer, ångesten är helig,

ångesten gömmer

ett utav stegen, som behövas -

ångesten hotar

alla rodnande händer,







ångesten vill intet,

ångesten äger intet,

ångesten har intet att förlora,

ångesten hotar

alla som snuddar utan att vilja -

dra dig undan

ångestens smala händer,

ångesten gömmer

heligt ett utav stegen som behövas -


visa icke



visa icke ditt ansikte

för världen,

ditt ansikte är

för striden,

ditt ansikte är

visiret att tecknas av hugg,

visiret får

icke fläckas

med förtidig glädjes bitande fläckar,

ditt ansikte är fanan att

ödmjukt lägga, riven

men ofläckad i barnets hand,

eller okännbar trampas

i hopplöshetens seger,

ditt ansikte är

för striden,

visa icke ditt ansikte

för världen -


när havet är dolt



när havet är dolt

bakom dödens lekstuguväggar,

när dimmorna leker på havet

dödslekarnas tusende påhitt,

hala med bortvänt ansikte din båt på stranden,







göm i smyg ankaret i sand,

lägg stenar på ringen -

allt blir ruttet då,

stäng fönstren, bed icke,

varje mod blir synd -


stäng in dig



stäng in dig i din kammare

med din svaghets guld,

vänta i din kammare,

tills kärlekens mod har kommit,

vänta,

tills ett öppet svärd ligger

mellan vad du måste och vad du icke

längre kan -


vi måste älska



vi måste älska

svaghetens timmar,

vi måste skydda

sjukdomens viljor -

förrän den svaga striden

har stridit sitt blod

och alla sjuka viljor vunnit seger,

är den starkaste arm svag

och inget vårt -


midvinternatt



- genom blinda, vita nätter

karvar jag

med enkelhetens späda kniv mitt märke

i de största träden -

de största träden förstår ingenting och susar

dova ord, som ingenting menar, och







som de själva tror, är lösningen

på månen och vindarna -

- snart lyser gult

som brinnande kåda enkelhetens späda märke

genom dovt fallande skogar

på alla träd -


vad är det



vad är det, du kallar fara,

lilla du,

vad är det, du är rädd att mista -?

det minsta hopp, du skulle

finna bland stenarna, är

värt allt,

du måtte ha gömt

undan djuren på din vandring,

innan du hann stranden -


fjällvatten



den vita älven

rinner forsande,

hatfull förbi det block,

där en skärva sitter

som ett öga -



tag, vita ström,

allt som vacklar,

hata, hopplöst sinande,

din vita grumlighet

mot blocket -



när dina sista

källor äro torra,

vända sig

bergets rubiner ut -






förklaring



att rovan är grön

och smal,

kommer sig bara därav,

att regnet icke

kom i augusti och september,

men i oktober -

rovan är grön och torr, det

kommer sig därav -


måneord





månen hänger, tyst räknande

hästar och huvuden -

månen vet,

att hetsande moln

bara finns stunden,

då de täcker honom -

månen vet, att ångesten hatar

rötter och lökar -

månen skär tyst

livets rispa genom jakten -


september



- sök havet, då

det en kväll efter äska bär

sin varma dallrande stiltje

om hösten -

det händer någon gång då,

att små svart-vita änder dyker upp,

och skriker till varandra,

likt de hårda ögonblick, som blixtrande

räddar glädjen, och försvinner -

någon enda kväll,

dä havet tyst kysser klipporna

och obevekligt låter båtarna

lägga sig, som de vill -






skapa



skapa dig en värld

utav gärningar -

lät följderna rulla likt

ständigt olika stenar

nedför branterna, som lovar havet,

och stumt hopar enastående skärvor

period efter period -

skapa dig världar,

låt dem rulla likt stenar -


skepp



låt alla de tidiga skeppen

gå halvfulla eller tomma

i ljusa dagsresor -,

göm de tyngsta dyrbarheterna,

att det sena skeppet må

gå tungt i sjön, blänkande

svart av last -


dagarna



dagarna äro nätter,

ljuset är fjärran från sol,

dagarna ska du känna, icke

på deras namn,

dagarna ska du känna på friheten,

fly måste du ljuset, tills du vågar

kalla det sol -

locka icke maskarna att flyga,

dagarna äro nätter -


dans



hatvild dansar

min vrede -,

mjukt glider







tårarnas dans -,

ångest tutar

skrän -

min fröjd sitter

på en brun stol -


bortom



ständigt blixtrar det, fast

molnen stå fjärran -

dansa icke,

fastän det spelas,

blixtarna väsa bortom

hoppets och förtvivlans toner,

dansa icke,

ständigt blixtrar det -

molnen stå fjärran,

bortom förtvivlan och hopp -


aningar



solen vandrar

ung, tyst och strålande

över klipporna, ejdrarna och husen,

lugnt, säkert -

sedan lägger hon sig

som en löftesrik gula

i havets morgonlovande vita -



tysta klippor

moderligt bekymrade ejdrar

och blinda hus

diskutera med havet

mina aningar,

om de kanske än

ändå skulle vara sanna -







båten driver,

mina armar ha domnat,

jag viskar

mot tjärdoftande botten:

jag tror på tystnaden

och morgondagen,

jag hatar det, som man vet -,

och jag väntar på

att livet skall lyfta

mig som en rödgul rova mot solen,

eller tyst gömma mig

under dimman som ett misstag -


till dig



att allt, som är möjligt,

framträder, skiljer sig

och dödande blommar,

vill livet-

..... vad du och jag vill -

vi försöker -

om friheten och ungdom

blir vårt barn,

då kanske vi lyckas -

horisonten är lika fjärran nu -

och livet gynnar ingen -


syn



tvenne kannor möttes -

den ena var rund och

hade en svart sol målad

på sin mage -,

den andra hade en smärt öppnad hals

och vita och bruna ränder

längs höfterna -

ångande fyllde de varandra -

om gift eller kärlek visste icke de,







och såg icke jag -

ur bägges munnar fladdrade ångan

blandande sig

med andra, främmande dofter -


flykt



låt oss hemligt och stolt bära ödmjukhet

genom dagarna -

vårt liv är en fantastiskt gammal,

stinkande kokott, smekande

nyanserat, raffinerat, så att vi glömma

hennes leenden,

hennes dumma händer -

låt oss smyga som hövdingar, galna av stolthet,

alla stigar,

som icke äro hennes,

bärande vår sista ödmjukhet

som guld -


den unga fursten



den unga fursten ser

tankfullt på solen och havet,

om de kanske skulle

vara användbara

för hans hand i morgon -



en kvinna tigger skälvande

vid hans fötter:

- tag bort pinan,

tag bort frukten ur mitt sköte,

giv tillbaka mig åt lammet, det enda,

som icke vill strypa min spira -

varför måste jag spännas,

krossad, vid din blinda frukt,

som du blott slängde







likt en sten någonstans -

förbannad vare du av mitt gift -

varför skall du vara hög och dum

som ett verktyg -



den unga fursten ser

tankfullt på spräckliga fjädrar bland havstången,

om de kanske skulle vara användbara

en kväll eller någon gång -

sen vandrar han långsamt

bort, grubblande morgondagar -


hon



- fattig, övermäktig av hat,

vågade jag språnget från

fängelsegluggen -,

naken, jagad till vanvett,

slukade mig skogen -

strålande, rik och stolt

trampade hon

på min hand, där jag låg,

och bjöd mig allt, hon ägde

mot min kärlek -

jag räckte henne, törstande, min

nakna uselhet,

jag blev stark och rik -

- alla, som jag mötte sedan,

bad mig om, vad jag skänkt -,

alla, som jag gav utav min rikedom,

har dött usla dödar -

och mina skatter av is och blod

är outtömliga, och själv

har jag aldrig vågat smaka -

- i fasans fjärran skog

sitter hon,

saligt lekande med min lycka -






barnet



när barnet vill plocka en blomma

och icke får,

då gråter barnet utanför stängslet

eller skriker högt och stampar med foten

eller går tyst bort att söka annat,

som det kanske får och som också är vackert att ta -



........ och när de gamla

har byggt så mycket stängsel

att inget finns för dem, som de får,

och. som tillika är vackert och mjukt att ta i,

då bygger de sig mörkbruna hus

att sitta i på kvällarna och sjunga

dova krypande sånger

till gudar utav spindelväv och damm -

när barnen sover, förgråtna eller lugnt leende,

då låter från de stängda mörkbruna husen

klagosångerna mot dödens lycka bakom tillbommade fönster -


lutadig



luta dig mot mig -

jag innehåller din vila -,

jag äger att utstycka din kraft -

luta dig mot mig -

jag är ett träd, du

ett annat -


nätter



jag häller drömmar ur en kruka

och vin ur en kanna -

i ditt glas simmar solen och månen -

låt oss dricka -

ana livets doft

efter tusen nätter som denna -






kan det finnas



kan det finnas en kvinna,

som är min mor,

det måste vara en stor kvinna,

att hålla mig fast vid sin barm,

det måste vara en stor kvinna,

att hålla mitt slutlugnt,

så att icke mitt slut ska skrika

dödens hat mot hennesmjukabröst -


ond visa



göm undan trummorna

och fiolerna -, det måste

komma dagar,

då du skulle ångra att

ha använt dem nu -

när trummornas och fiolernas dagar

ha kommit, skulle du

hata dig att ha använt

dem nu -


när -?



i min svarta skål

bredvid varandra

fyra blodröda bär,

ännu orörda -

när skall du våga

ta i mina blodröda bär och bita i dem,

tills du drunknar i min blindhet -,

skall du någonsin

våga snudda vid min svarta skål -?

skall jag någonsin

tvingas lämna,

för väder och vind att leka med,







min svarta skål,

för att leta nya bär, lika

glödande, tigande,

eller ännu blodrödare,

för någon annan -, okänd

att få offra sitt anlete åt en ny blindhet,

som fjärran -,

dock måste vara min -


fallande blomblad



bägaren är bräddfylld, därför

måste du dricka -

se icke på bägarens vägg,

tänk icke på framtidens smärta -

dropparna äro dyrbara,

bägaren är bräddfylld nu -

därför måste du dricka -


kom -!



kom -, rus,

tugga mig -

kom -, storm,

slit rodret från min hand -

kom, krypande dimmor,

kom, låt mig segra, utan

vilja och utan styre -


fienden



bara segern och vilan äro gemensamma,

det finns inga gemensamma strider,

alla strider äro f järran från vilan,

alla strider ha bara en fiende,

alla strider brytas i mörker,

där ingen ser, bara slår







fienden -

låt oss dela

vilans och fröjdens längtan,

striden måste dansas i mörkret,

ensam med allas fiende -


vapen



stolthet -, tystnad -,

vapnen, som skyddar

den enda, längsta

vägen -

det finns ingen egen

seger, ingen egen

död -,

det finns bara livets

nederlag i dig, eller din

öppenhet utan tvekan, när

rösterna talar eller krusar havet

med sina andedräkter -


längtan



grym är min trötthet,

min hopplöshet hungrar blod,

min kärlek finns icke,

mina händer ha blivit fina och kalla

som ormar -



men bittert redo är jag

att som en tigerhona skydda

livets första blomma -

blind är min stolthet,

dödande min tystnad,

hopplöst redo är jag

varje timme -






avsked



återigen har jag gjort

mig resfärdig -

en trång kruka med ädelt vin -,

om det värsta skulle hända -

sedan bara vapen,

härliga vapen, kloka och visa vapen -

och många, många vapen,

det kommer att fräsa

ur kallheten

och blixtra ur hatet nu -

efteråt -?

efteråt ska vi skratta,

om icke det värsta har hänt,

nu måste vi skiljas -


törnet



stör mig icke -

låt mig icke veta främmande lögner -

jag älskar icke ensamheten -

jag älskar ingenting -

jag ville -

jag kunde -

stör mig icke -

jag måste vara -

fläcka icke vad, som icke är -


nu



dödens syror äger alla rikedomar -,

gråa stenen har blivit liv -,

vanvettet är sanningens hopp -

alla rikedomar har blivit billiga -

blodets fattigdom är

diamanten, som skär sten i skivor åt solens käftar -,







blodets sol törstar vanvett

och kräkes rikedom -,

gråa stenen har blivit liv -


endast då



när förtvivlan har ätit allt,

som fanns i ditt hus och i ditt hjärta,

kom då -

när alla eldar ha brunnit ner,

och alla stormar ha andats ut,

när, i gränslöst tålamod, bara förtvivlan

dröjer hos dig,

kom då -

jag ska ge dig

tron på blodets stumma seger

över alla viljor och alla segrar -


bröd



berusa dig varje timme -

timmarna måste bli år -

berusa dig -!

livet är en dröm -

ruset är hata död -

ruset dränker dig

i livets bröd -

berusa dig varje timme -!

timmarna måste förbli unga -,

brödet är ungdomens sten -


eld



det, som du tar

av begär, är ditt -,

vad, som bjudes dig,

är synd -







dränk grävande ditt spett bland blodets skatter -,

välj djupt -!

önskan av sten är begär av blod,

stenens kraft är blind -

eld är hårda hjärtan -,

eld måste brinna -,

sten och eld är mörker -

lyckan är svart -


porträtt



vad du vet, struntar jag i,

hela världens visdom skiter jag på,

stoft vill jag ha,

ett par hav utav stoft behöver jag,

jag är arbetare,

jag förbrukar inget,

i andra skepnader

ger jag allt tillbaka -,

jag dör fult,

om jag icke kan arbeta -,

stoft vill jag ha,

kakor av stoft måste jag äta

alla timmar -,

jag är arbetare,

jag skiter i allt annat,

vad du vet, och hela världens visdom,

jag behöver inget veta,

blott stoft och återigen stoft behöver jag,

stoft måste fylla mina händer

och min mun alla timmar -


bad



titta på mitt bröst -!

det är ungdomens bröst,

svällande av hårdhet -

hoppet är underbart hårt som bara fan -,







mitt blod är ett enda tveäggat hot

mot alla fiskar, som har buken uppåt -

dödens bad är svalt efter alla rus -

en hunger, som min, känner bara sig själv -,

en hunger, som min, har tagit av sig varje känsla

för att kunna simma fritt -,

hoppet är underbart hårt och tungt och svart

att ta i med hatets unga, berusade nävar -

mitt bröst har ett skratt

så hårt, att havet vänder sig -

den enda vägen är mitt bröst -


bort -!



våra båtar duger icke längre -,

för bräckliga, för tunga i vattnet -,

vårt mod är för trött för sådana fartyg -

små, starka lätta båtar är vad vi behöver -

vi måste berusa oss i starkt vin, att

vi glömmer havet,

att vi glömmer livet,

att bara giftet finns -,

vi måste berusa oss i vin, att

våra lätta båtar blir väldiga skepp,

som glömskt och obevekligt går mot kustar,

som icke ens ruset vågat nämna -

bort måste vi -,

andra båtar måste vi skaffa oss -,

landet fördärvar vårt blod -


fiskare



klipp sönder era nät, fiskare,

vidare maskor fordras det,

om ni vill bli riktiga, stora fiskare -

större maskor och

flera fiskenätter och

hårdare längtan fordras det,







om ni vill bli verkligen

stora fiskare -

klipp sönder era nät,

låt fångsten leka,

dra vidare nät

fortare, tystare genom vattnet

i många flera nätter, o fiskare, storfångare -!


framtiden



lär dig svälta,

snart kommer framtiden

med sin gåva,

fattigt är dess leende,

tomma dess händer -

lär dig spara,

snart kommer framtiden

med sin skål,

fattig är din ungdom,

tag gåvan, att få

giva ditt mod -

lär dig tro,

framtiden är ett under:

en sol, som befruktar

ett hat-stelnat sköte,

en måne, som svalkar

utbrända hjärtan,

lär dig sjunga

om småfågelägg i våldets nävar,

och segerleenden i de slagnas skål -

lär dig tigga,

snart faller från nödens regnbåge

framtidens enda slant -


porträtt



svarta ögon,

ragg -







tunga läppar,

mummel -

händer, långsamma,

dova,

blixtsnabba -

- huvudet reses,

handen faller,

revolution -

en dov klagan,

kärlek -

bakifrån:

hund -


natt



- himlen mörknar

ödena samlar sig

mänskolivet sover

vårens eller höstens sömn -

- ödena talar,

sol och måne väntar -



- natten vänder sig dröjande

mänskolivet kvider i sömnen

ödena väntar

att skåda verkställelsen -


ord



inför det stora och enkla

äro orden dimmiga

och tonfallet allt -

inför det falska och oäkta

fattas mig ord -

jag trampar med skrovlig häl

rot, stängel, allt,

lyftande hat och mord







som livets kross-spark

åt döden -

ångest-blind famlande:

blomma

sol

mänska -


visa



- de, som ha minst,

komma at segra -

de, som äga,

komma att dö -

nöden är ett vapen -

mättnaden en lucka -

ingen får välja -

ingen bryter lagen -


nödens trygghet



jag själv är av mörker

har alltid varit -

en del av mig,

jag vet ej vilken,

finnes i andra nejder -

den viskar mig främmad

allt jag behöver att veta -

den viskar från

nejder, långt från allt mörker,

den ser mig aldrig

och min panna böjd genom mörkret,

dess blick är vänd

mot andra klarare öden -

i nödens bittraste timme

skall en iskall vind

från ljusa okända nejder

viska mig allt, jag behöver -






diktaren



nu vill jag berätta

för dig vad en diktare är:

han ärdimmanytterst

på horisonten,

han är ryggen utav det,

som varit,

och hans panna ärstrimmansom dröjer

på nattens gräns,

hans ögon äro ibland trötta

av att vänta efter det,

som han icke vet, om det finns,

och ibland äro de blinda

av en sol på andra sidan

dimman -

då gråter diktaren, tills

dimman har ryckt längre bort,

och väntandets ångest åter

svalkarhans svidande ögonlock -

diktaren är han, som

antingen är en dåre eller en vis,

han, som

varje timme väljer,

om han vill leva eller

alltid ha varit död -

at turde give -

for mig

at give, findes ikke her -,

her findes is og storm,

og deres skæbne

bærer jeg -

- i ensomhedens øde skove gør jeg bod -

min fornemhed

kender ingen grænser -,

den kender skæbnens

bud og intet andet -


nat - nat - nat-



- det, som lyser mig,

kan jeg ikke -

det, som jeg kan,

sværter mig -

- naar jeg mættes,

- mindes jeg -

- naar jeg glemmer,

- hungrer jeg -

- søvnen, som gaar,

- vækker vildskab,

- som ikke vil gaa -

min hunger har intet at faa -


nødens tryghed



jeg selv er af mørke

har altid været -

en del af mig

jeg ved ej hvilken

findes i andre egne -

den hvisker mig fremmed

alt jeg behøver at vide -

den hvisker fra







egne, langt fra alt mørke,

den ser mig aldrig

og min pande bøjet i mørke,

dens blik er vendt

mod andre klarere skæbner -

i nødens bitreste time

skal en iskold vind

fra lyse ukendte egne

hviske mig alt jeg behøver -


vi stolte



lad os bøje os,

vi stolte -,

lad os søge et haab -



lad os aabne os,

vi store -,

lad os vise vor armod -



lad os tale,

vi stærke -,

lad os dræbe vort had -



lad os bøje os,

lad os søge et haab -


se -!



du er ikke ond

og ikke god,

ikke vis

og ikke svag -

hemmelige fremtidsviljer

bruger dig -

alle er vi udvalgte,

alle skal vi dø -

viljerne bruger os -







ingen kan dømmes,

og ingen er kronet -

hemmelige fremtidsviljer

borer sig

gennem os

frem -


flygt!



med hænderne knuget

i en krampe, haardere end sten,

med øjnene

blinde af en gnist,

som hverken er haab eller glæde,

med fødderne tvunget af en vilje,

hinsides baade menneske og fremtid,

flygt -!



flygt, skjult af en vildskab,

som dræber, hader alt,

som elsker

eet,

flygt, frælsende den draabe i dig,

som livet vilde dø

uden -


i nat



i nat frøs

tøsneen ikke -

sirenerne skreg

i mildhedens taage -

jorden vældede blød

frem af drivernes skred -



luftens isnende tomhed

fyldes af væde -

lysende damp







dækker maanens lys -

jorden skinner brun

mod morgenens tøvende magt -

havet aander blegt,

før solen rejser sig -


digt



jeg er en fattig synder,

der søger harmoni -

oh, sollyse drifter og

skumle lyster og mord

og pjerrot-løgne -

solen gaar ned i natten

og kommer igen med dag -

i et kammer, i en mands figur

sidder sjælen med lyse øjne -

sorgen over livet

er det dejligste haab -

sang



- fløjt klingende din vise om en gylden dag -,

klag din knugende smærte i moll -

sandheden hvisker nynnende melodien

i krattet bag grøften,

i stuens mørke -

- glæd dig, lyttende vandrer,

over harmoniens naadegave -,

flygt, ilsomt og stille,

for tonernes dystre kamp -

stemmer og toner besvarer, vandrer,

knivskarpt dit spørgende smil -


bølger



- solens sendags-skraa spyd

svingende stikker i havet,

glashuden hæver sig dirrende

og glattes ud,

kysten gennem dis er grøn,

blegblaarøde vandmænd stiger

mod guldlys,

suges mod havbund,

driver bølgende mod mad og død -

solpile vakler og falder,

kysten vender sig bort,

vindstille matblaa bølger

mumler havbølgers nat -


hvidt



en hvid bugnende snesky

en hvid skraat spejlende maane

et barns skrig







en hvidmalet baad paa bedding

sorte bølgers merke skvulp

og skridt af træsko

paa en sildeskællet kaj

tegner fosforsyngende

oktobernattens bidende kontur -

viben skriger

en cirkel sort

skriger en kurve hvid

i luften -

saltengen drejer sig

grøn-graa vaad

med et lukket æg

havet glider rødmende

ind i solens ild,

aften aander salt

en maage forsvinder i sløret sus,

fiskeren vaagner til dag -

oktobers horisont

er højere end kirkens spir -

paa dens takkede kant

paa kysten hamrer havet sort

kløver pindebrænde

med smaa økser -

sorthvide maager

med gule næb mod sommerbrisen

paa skærets ryg -

en sæl drejer et sort hoved

frem og tilbage kiggende

langs havspejlet -

skærets eneste asters brænder violet

i solen -

fluerne danser over

maagernes mødding -

sælen forsvinder -

maagerne letter -

strandastersen sidder fast i sin revne -

et rødt sejl dukker op -

havet mod klippernes tænder

lukker havnene

vestbrise puffer søerne væk,

gammel brænding falder

tung paa skæret -

fiskerne kigger -

regngraa stormvind

trykker vintersæds blaagrønne spirer

mod sorte knolde -







markerne bølger tungt,

dunkel-grønne haar følger

i nikkende dans stormens

isnende strøg over krybende muld -

himlen kaster sig sort udad

mod havet -

grønne spirer nikker i takt

flimrende under stormens slør -


rødt og sort



de grønne blade blir gule -

stormene river

maaned efter maaned -

gul-røde blade klamrer sig til sorte grene -

langsomt vrider regnen stilkene løse -

saften staar stille i roden -



under jagende himmel

sover mulden sin hvile -

grønne menneskehjærter sortner -

menneskenes storme blødende nærmer sig -

forvirrings regn siver nat og dag -

hjærtets love mørner -

efteraars straalende pragt

vandrer i døde kolonner

- solen er fjernest nu -


konturløst



oktober regn-storm pisker fra land,

havet kryber,

bygerne hvinende stryger,

lave sorte, pressende havet ned -

vandet synker

skærene ligger blottede,

et opankret skib







staar taarnhøjt, opslugt i dis,

en kone paa dækket

med kikkert ser intet -

over landet en tidlig maane

suser gennem rygende skyer -

en lille baad flygter

væltende mod havn -

stille regn falder

gennem natten -

over den anden kyst

hviner stormen -

her falder regnen stille -

fra en graa himmel

usynlig i natten

falder regndraaberne

paa huse og marker og baade,

og paa klipperne ved havet -

og gør alting vaadt

i nattens stilhed -

fra den anden side øen

høres stormens hvinen

svagt -


pynten



selv naar det er stille,

naar blot en enkelt graa sky

haenger tung ved solnedgang,

rejser bølgen sig højt i vejret

paa skæret ud for pynten -

mod pyntens sorte stenknold

falder bølgen ned igen

med sne-hvidt brus -

under tungt hængende himmel

med en gul stribe i vest -






se!



se solen, solen,

føl luften i det levende bryst,

græsset under foden i glæde, glæde -,

endnu lever du jo -!

o, se, solen staar op,

se, dit barn sover,

- se -!

endnu lever du jo,

din kvinde glæder sig i dit hus -

- fyld dine øjne med det varme, herlige lys -,

levende broder!


morgen



i vintermorgens sorte mørke

lyder fra huse hanernes kor -

skygger af mænd

tramper mod havnens lygte -

motorers dunk trækker usynlige baade

mod pibende hav -

istunge byger fejer fra lave tage

kulrøgens brune sløjfer

udover havet -


bøn



magter, som styrer himlen og jorden

solen og stormen og havet,

magter, som styrer, usynligt for blikket,

trældom og nød, skælvende glæde,

krige og rædsler, skændsel og synd,

magter, jeg tigger i pine,

giv mig lys for mit virke,

magter, lad mig ikke dø unyttig,

mægtige, brænd eders mærke

dybt ind i mit vaklende sind -

baade følger

stimende sild -

over landet i vest

gnistrer en stjærne grønt -



TILLÆG







prosafragment

I. november

i skoven er der mørkt - det er næsten nat - langt borte fra sit hus løber stenka - søgende -, med bøssen i haanden ogjagttaskenpaa ryggen -, tom - hans arbejdende øjne roder i mørket - se kan han ikke - men lede - søge - finde - hvis der er noget at finde - af og til kalder han sagte og gennemtrængende: gripsy, gripsy, her, kom -! han standser og lytter - intet høres - stenka løber langs skovens kant - og langs gaardenes yderste marker, der lyser under den tynde sne - det er nu fire timer siden han gik ud for at jage - gripsy, hans hund erforsvundet- frivilligt er den ikke kommet væk fra ham - maaske har nogen stjaalet den - før, da det endnu var lyst, hørte stenka et skud - er det haren, der er blevet skudt - eller - eller har den satans bonde skudt hunden -? ingen lyd svarer hans kalden - maaske er den vendt hjem efter at have mistet følingen med sin herre - stenka standser og puster - saa bøjer han af - ind i skoven - krumbøjet løber han under granerne med øjnene halvt lukkede mod grenenes snærtende slag -glidende,økonomisk løber han - af og til hviler han ved at gaa - han kommer ud paa en plads med spredte høje graner - en klump paa en høj gren - sortere end nattehimlen - en tør gren knækker under hans bremsende skridt - klumpen gir et ryk - lynsnart skyder han - et par larmende vingeslag og tjurhønen ligger for hans fødder - den er stor og fed - han stopper den i tasken - men hvor er gripsy -? hvorfor fanden skulde han have skudt hende -? stenka løber videre - han er træt nu - der er en halv mil tilbage - det sidste stykke gaar han - han gider ikke holde grenene fra sig - de smider sne over hans nakke og skuldre - slaar ham paa munden - ved stammen paa en birk hænger en afplukket grangren og en tør pind ved siden afhinanden- stenkas mærke - bare et par skridt til hytten - saadanne mærker er anbragt i en stor cirkel hele vejen rundt om hans hus - med et sæt synker han i knæ - fra hyttens tag flyver en gnist - endnu en - en hel række - røde draaber, der falder -, opad mod himlen - stenka spænder sine øjne til det yderste - der maa være nogen - nogen har gjort ild i hans hus -! stenka kender ingen her - der har aldrig i de otte maaneder, han har boet her,



været andre end han selv paa dette sted - eller i alt fald i huset - forsigtigt, liggende paa knæ i skoven, spænder han hanen paa sit gevær - med tre spring staar han i døraabningen - ved den nylig tændte ild sidder en sorthaaret kvinde og smiler - stenka maaber og piller langsomt patronen ud af bøssen og stikker den i lommen - "hvad vil du?" siger han - han er ikke vant til at tale til mennesker - hun ser paa ilden, lægger et par pinde paa, stryger en stribe haar fra panden og svarer stille: "jeg er manja, jeg er ikke herfra" som om det skulde være en anbefaling - lidt efter: "i sandviken hørte jeg, at din hund var skudt - det var forstanderen for fattighuset, der saa den og skød den af forvirring og forskrækkelse - saa gik jeg herop - det var ikke let at finde -" manja smiler igen - stenka lægger bøsse ogjagttaskefra sig og sætter sig - manja kigger i ilden - saa bøjer hun sig frem og tar fuglen ud af tasken, kaster et hurtigt blik paa stenka og begynder at rense fangsten - stenka er tavs - han sidder længe som om han tænkte - saa rejser han sig og gaar ned til bækken, slaar hul paa isen, fylder sin spand og bærer den uden at spilde en draabe ind og stiller den ved siden af kvinden - fra en krog henter han en gryde og en krukke med smør - manja ser op - fjerene flyver om fingrene paa hende - atter smilende hvisker hun: "salt!" men stenka smiler ikke - lydløst rejser han sig fra sin seng af faareskind og henter saltet - han sætter det, uden at tænke derover, saa langt fra hende, at hun næsten maa rejse sig for at naa det -

- natten er dyb som en skakt - men du sidder paa bundens mørke fløjl og der er ingensteds at falde - og ved siden af dig brænder og varmer et lille lys - saadan er stenkas hytte iskovendenne nat i november - der er ingen vind og vinterens kulde skraber sig frem langs jorden mellem stammeme langt nede fra elvenes og de store søers frostcentraler - og de første dage efter denne nat er der ingen dyr fremme - i ubevægelig venten i reder og huler vænner de sig til vinterens nye pels - og stenka spiser sit første rigtige maaltid efter den lange dag - og mens han gnaver de fede fuglelaar, venter manja paa sin andel og fortæller stenka om sin hævnplan - hun vil gaa ned tilkøbmanden- han har en hunhund, der har løbetid nu, ved hun - og hun vil lukke den ud af skuret, hvor den klager om sin spildte brunst, og tage den med sig til sandviken - to gange vil hun gaa frem og tilbage mellem de spredte huse i den lille landsby, og saa vil hun gaa ud i skoven med tæven og vente - saa vil alle den skyldige landsbys hanhunde søge sig efter hende



i hundeelskovens duftspor - og hun vil ligge paa lur og vente - og hun vil skyde dem alle - hver eneste en som hævn overniddingsdaadetmod stenkas gripsy - saadan er hendes plan - heller ikke nu smiler stenka - han rækker resterne fra sit maaltid over mod hende og siger: "hvorfor? til hvad nytte? -" saa lægger han sig uden et ord mere til at sove - og manja er alene med hans rolige aandedrag og skoven og natten og de sluknende gløder fra ildstedet -

II. stenkas tale

det er morgen -, og atter fire maaneder er gaaet - foran huset er en lille plads, hvor nogle graner er fældet - her staar stenka - bjærget falder lige akkurat saa stejlt ned, at stenka over de nærmeste trætoppe føler solen og skimter søen som et stykke lysende staaltraad langt nede i dalen - stilheden er kolossal - skovens milelange stier fører ikke ud af den - stilheden aftager ikke, hvor langt man end gaar - her bliver den - og den er ikke ond - blot rummer den alt - hver lyd -, et egern, som gnaver, en urfugl, som selve det at b1ive, har gjort rædselsslagen, og som flyver sin skraa dinglende larm for at lande efter et halvt minut fuldstændig rolig -, et par grankogler, der raslende glider ned - stilheden behøver ikke engang at synke -, alt udviskes og forsvinder - stilheden er for stor - intet kan udfylde den - og solen stiger ikke op her - den lever her - solen er stilheden - solen er skovens ubevægelige grønne sandhed - skoven er det modsatte af løgn - skovens øjne ser opad og nedad - skoven har selv løst sin gaade - og skoven opfylder selv sin gaade - for skoven er kravet gaade - og at se gaaden er at opfylde kravet - solens krav - og solen lever her - sommetider er den kra- vets sol, som skænker gaadernes løsning til dem, sommodtagerkravet - sommetider er den kærlighedens sol - hvid og blaa ser den, at dette hjærte er for stort og tungt, og den lader en dolk lysende sprænge nattens skal - og den ser, at dette sværd har hvæsset sig for langt og tyndt, og den lader det styrtende synke i et bundløst hjærte - og sommetider er den godhedens sol, som med sorte straaler blænder øjne og tvinger dem at lukkes - eller uimodstaaeligt lokkende kalder: du har gjort, hvad jeg vilde -, kom -! og bagved, med alt i sin mund,



straaler vejenes sol, livets sol - og vejenes sol er blevetmenneskenesfjende -, fordi dens mund er lukket og tavs for alle, før de er naaet halvvejs ad den længste af veje, som ikke er nogen vej, men solens mund og skød, hvorfra livet falder - og derfor kalder menneskenes hjærter solen for dødens og krigens sol, fordi alle kræfter i verden er fjender, og solens kraft af alle er den største -

og derfor venter solen -, nu dagens og mandens gule sol -, og de vældige skove og de lange søer venter, og elvene venter, alle med den store stilhed over deres aasyn - og ingen lyd høres - og stenka staar foran sit hus og venter paa, at morgensolen skal naa hans ansigt -

hvem er stenka?

stenka er en mand paa omkring femogtyve menneskeaar; han kom for 13 maaneder siden og byggede sig det lille hus, han nu staar med ryggen til, og hvor han siden har boet - ingen ved rigtig, hvem han er, bortset fra, at han er udlænding, dansk eller tysk, (man har gættet paa tysk flygtning) og at han ser mærkelig ud - man ved, at han nu hovedsagelig lever af jagt - og, at han hidtil regelmæssigt har betalt sin smule leje af stedet og jagten i de omliggende skove - men, hvad han før har haft for arbejde eller bestilling der, hvor han kommer fra, har ingen kunnet sige - de eneste, der har talt med ham, er købmanden i den to mil borte beliggende landsby og bonden, der hævder at eje skoven - og til dem har han aldrig sagt andet, end detnødvendigsteog kun, hvad der angik deres forretningsmæssige forhold -

karlen hos købmanden har lavet vittigheden: lukket foran og aaben bag, paa grund af hans skæg og, at han en dag, han var nede for at købe tobak og ammunition, havde haft et hul bag i sine bukser - og ingen undtagen skolelærerens 14-aarige søn, har overhovedet set hans bolig, og denne endda kun udvendig - drengen havde med besvær fundet vej op til hytten - der var ingen stier i forvejen, og da stenka sjældent gik samme vej, var der heller ikke blevet traadt nogen ny - først kunde denforventningsfuldedreng slet ikke finde noget hus - han fandt en stabel brænde under et grantræ, og han kunde lugte en ild i nærheden - endelig opdagede han, lurende bag en stor trærod, der var revet op paa højkant, da træet blæste om, at stenka havde dækket hele huset med friske graner og store grangrene,



baade langs væggene og paa taget, saa at det næsten var umuligt at skælne hans bolig fra den omgivende skov - men lige, da drengen skulde til at rejse sig fra sit skjulested for at gaa rundt om huset for, om muligt, at komme det nærmere fra en anden side (han turde ikke aabenlyst gaa frem, da han ikke havde kunnet finde noget rimeligt paaskud for et besøg), saa han et geværløb blive stukket ud mellem grenene paa et grantræ 20 meter borte og rettes lige imod sig - bøssens ejermand sagde intet, og drengen havde ikke kunnet se ham - men bevidstheden om, at han aabenbart havde været iagttaget længe, og at hans nærværelse paa stedet øjensynlig ikke ønskedes, havde været tilstrækkelig til at faa ham til at lægge benene paa nakken og hurtigst muligt søge sig hjemad -

dette var det eneste, man vidste om den besynderlige stenkas hus - bonden, som ejede skoven, boede langt borte fralandsbyenog interesserede sig ikke synderligt for sin lejers bolig, da han var ængstelig for, at der skulde kunne afkræves ham hjælp under en eller anden form, hvis han viste sig for indladende - en af de første gange stenka havde været hos købmanden, havde han foruden sin bøsse (som tilsyneladende var af udenlandsk konstruktion), en lang stav med et udskaaret S paa den ene side og et underligt mærke, ogsaa udskaaret, paa den anden - begge forsiringer havde været farvet blaa, maaske med blæk -købmandenhavde spurgt ham, om mærket skulde forestille et øje, og dertil havde stenka svaret ja, uden nærmere at forklare meningen med at have et øje udskaaret paa sin stok - en lørdag, lige efter at han var kommet til egnen, var han gaaet den lange vej ned til "biografen", en forhenværende lade med filmsapparat og dansegulv, hvor der var dans - alle havde kigget og hvisket - og at gaa femten kilometer i ti graders frostgennemskoven iført nypresset citydress og laksko - !bønderdrengenehavde let højlydt, medens de saa til den modsatte side, af hvor han sad, og pigerne havde fniset med den dybeste foragt i stemmen og skælvende beundring i øjnene - menefterhaandenvar lyset blevet dæmpet af mangel paa petroleum, og man havde ikke rigtig kunnet se, være sig skægget eller lakskoene

og stenka havde kun danset een dans - og med den pige, som alle helst vilde i lag med, men som de ogsaa alle generede sig for bare at danse med - pigerne hadede og haanede hende - mændene beskæftigede sig ikke med hende, men hendesnærværelsevar tilstrækkelig til at tage interessen fra de andre piger

- stenka havde altsaa danset en dans med hende - man havde



ikke kunnet se, hvordan han dansede, men selvfølgelig kunde han ikke danse som de andre - drengene havde faaet etplausibeltpaaskud for at kigge paa pigen, og de andre havde hvisket, at det var underligt, at hun kunde danse med ham - men efter at have været der i det hele kun en god halv time og uden at have danset mere end den samme dans, var den fremmede gaaet - og han havde ikke talt med nogen, han havde ikkeengangsagt god aften eller farvel -

dette er, bortset fra, at han bevislig aldrig afsendte eller modtog post, som muligvis havde kunnet give et holdepunkt i en eller anden retning, alt hvad man ved om stenka i landsbyen - og de forskelliges nysgerrighed sløvedes efterhaanden af mangel paa næring - stenka er blevet den fremmede, der er "lukket fortil og aaben bag" -

- og nu staar denne mand foran sit hus og venter paa solen, der ligger paa granerne helt nede ved søen -

hans mørkeblaa skjorte staar aaben og hans grønbrune bukser er stoppet ned i et par langskaftede lyse støvler, der skinner af fedt - om livet har han et bælte, strikket af hvid silketraad, og midt paa maven dingler en kniv i en lang skede med sølvknap underst - over den ene skulder hænger en skindjakke indvendig foret med egernskind -

stenka staar og skræver med hænderne i bukselommerne - hans mørkebrune bølgede pandehaar naar næsten helt ned til de sorte øjenbryn, der skraaner let opad ved enderne - han er meget velfriseret - skægget er rødt og lignerhageremmenpaa en græsk hjælm og ligesom holder haarets skal fast ned over hovedet og nakken paa ham - overskægget hænger ned i to spidser som en kinesers - hans tænder er blanke og tætte men ikke hvide - han staar og smiler - og gaar et par skridt opad for at se bedre - han gynger i knæene for hvert skridt - en ild knager inde fra huset -

stenka træder op paa en stor flad træstub - stadig medhændernei bukselommerne - han har en underlig bevægelse med kinderne, der strammer ansigtet og klemmer øjnene sammen til to haarde revner - og han taler med en lav, træagtig stemme: "jeg, stenka, med mig er ting sket mærkeligere, end de, der er sket med andre - jeg drog bort, fra hvor jeg før havde levet, og jeg vidste, at jeg aldrig vilde vende tilbage - og der, hvor jeg før havde levet, der var min moder død, og min elskede døde, og mine venner døde en efter en - og min fader havde jegaldrigkendt - og min elskede døde, fordi jeg aabnede de store



aarer, der gik over hendes hals med min kniv - og nu har jeg en anden kniv -"

medens stenka taler, har solen flyttet sig en anelse, og denvældernu ud over skoven, ned langs søen, ind i granernes tætte ro - og stenka gaar langsomt tilbage mod huset - et sekund tar sollyset skraat nedefra over hans ansigt, og det er, som om en stor lydløs latter har sovet bag pandehaaret, øjenbrynene og skægget og i dette sekund vaagner og i nøgen glæde træder ud gennem kinderne og drillende breder sig ud over hele stenkas ansigt - med sin nøgenhed dækker den hans øjne og lukker hans mund - nogle skridt fra døren kalder han stille: "jeg gaar nu, er det færdigt?" noget flyttes inde paa gulvet, en smal skygge gaar forbi ildskæret - stenka bøjer sig og tar jagttasken med maden, bøssen og patronbæltet og den korte økse, der som svar er blevet lagt ud i døraabningen - "jeg gaar ogsaa tilcigarmandeni dag -" med disse ord forsvinder stenka i skoven - han synker lidt i knæet for hver gang en støvle naar jorden - han gaar, som om han var en enkelt muskel af et større væsen

terrænet er fyldt med store sten og væltede træstammer, og hans skridt blir korte og gummiagtige - fra hoften og nedefter virker han larvefod - hans ryg er krum - han suger sig frem under granernes nedhængende grene - og en flad skraaning ligger foran ham - pladsen har aabenbart været ryddet for nogle aar siden - granerne er smaa og bløde - stenka løber - han lader foden glide lidt frem i den tynde sne - han løber hurtigt - naar han træder fejl -, naar foden naar den nedfaldne gren i stedet for den flade sten, ser han sig kort tilbage, truende ad sit sjuskeri - at løbe er en nydelse, men rigtigt - det er en melodi, han maa høre hver dag - og hans sammenknebne øjne blir mørke og blanke, naar han spiller rigtigt - han elsker dette at bevæge sig - han har tasken paa ryggen - bøssen i højre, øksen i venstre haand - af og til standser han og fælder et tørt træ og lægger det ud i sporene - brænde, som han skal tage med paa hjemvejen - han har skiftevis det ene og det andet øre bart - naar han fryser, trækker han skindhuens klap ned over det bare øre, og væk fra det andet - ved hver lyd standser han og staar uden en bevægelse og med munden halvaaben for at høre bedre

en urfugl?, en tjur?, en hare? eller bare et egern eller en skovskade - stenka gaar i retning mod "stormens eneste træ", et stort fyrretræ højt oppe paa den store slette øverst paabjærgryggen- enebærkrat, mos og tyttebærris - og bjærget, derlangsomtog atter skovklædt falder ned mod en anden, meget stor



og smal sø - 1 mil opad og en halv mil over isbelagtesmaamoseroppe paa bjærget - der plejer altid at være urfugl - allerede paa afstand høres enkelte smældende vingeslag - stenka sætter sig et øjeblik for at hvile - "jeg vil fortælle manja historien om, ja, jo, jeg vil kalde ham shojo, livetsdrukkenbolt-, ja, den historie vil jeg fortælle hende -" han tar et iskoldt æble frem af tasken og begynder at spise - han bider hele munden fuld og lævner kun blomsten og stilken - han stopper to patroner i bøssen og lægger den over knæene - saa tar han huen af og klør sig grundigt i hovedet, haler ensodavandsflaskemed kaffe frem og en pibe - "ja, jeg tænker, jeg maa snakke med hende - jeg har jo slet ikke snakket i lange tider - hun vil blive forbavset - hun ler saa sjov, naar hun er forbavset -"

han rejser sig og samler en bunke tørt brænde sammen oglæggerøksen og tasken ovenpaa og dækker det hele med en stor frisk grangren - hænger bøssen i remmen over skulderen og begynder at løbe - hans øjne griner - hans lange lave skridt mumler: stenka skal snakke - stenka skal snakke - stenka skal snakke -

paa tilbagevejen fra "stormens eneste træ" hviler han et øjeblik ved brændebunken - og belæsset med brænde og tre varmeurfugleslentrer han langsomt ned mod landsbyen, en stor vinkel udenom huset igennem den tætteste skov - til cigarmanden - omtrent halvvejs smider han brændet, de to af fuglene, bøssen og øksen, lægger et par tynde stammer ovenpaa mod dyr - griner lydløst i retning af sit hus og gaar skødesløst og uden byrder videre - i tanker -

III. festen

fra den undrende købmand og landsbyens spredte huse med benzintankens skilt som et øje i midten, et øje, der fortæller intet undtagen prisen paa benzin pr. liter, vandrer stenka paa vej hjem - i tasken har han tyve cigarer og et kilo kaffe,sukkerog salt - købmanden havde sagt tak for hver ting, stenka havde forlangt - tilsidst, da han havde betalt (cigarerne med den ene fugl), var takken blevet efterfulgt af et søgende "herr .....

herr..... mange tak..... herr ...... " men stenka var ikke gaaet i fælden, han havde ikke fuldført sætningen - og da han var gaaet forbi de sidste huse, havde han skimtet landsbyens sjæl, i



form af fladtrykte børneansigter i vinduerne, og døre, dertøvendeblev lukket, lige da han passerede - og stenka bestemmer, at der skal være fest i aften - i aften og i nat - hans første fest i hans ny hus - og i morgen vil han begynde at snakke - maaske allerede i nat - til festen - fest - i otte maaneder havde han med strænghed holdt stilheden ved lige i sit indre - i ottemaanederhavde han forberedt mødet mellem sit eget mysterium og det store mysterium - og nu var det sket - nu var det færdigt - nu vidste han, hvad han skulde vide - foreløbig - hans egetmysteriumvar forsvundet uden at gøre det store mysterium større

og i stedet for havde han faaet en lille del af det store, som han havde ladet gøre med sig, hvad det vilde - blot han tilgengældmaatte se, hvad det var, han skulde - hvad det var, det vilde -, hvad det var, han ikke havde vidst før - og som det var absolut nødvendigt for ham at vide - og nu var det sket, og han kunde gaa, hvorhen han vilde - men først skulde han takke det store, som havde vist sig for ham - og han skulde sige: din vej er fra nu af for evigt ogsaa min vej - og selv dit fald er sejr og tillige min - og (det største af alt:) din sejr vil blive ogsaa min sejr - og andet findes ikke for dig - han skulde takke

takke for, at han havde faaet et liv at leve - en herlig strid at kæmpe - og saa kunde han gaa - saa var han fri - fri -! men i nat skal der være fest - den store fest for ham selv - og manja skal være med ham - og han skal fortælle hende den lange og mærkelige historie om shojo, verdens drukkenbolt, jordens frælser -

det er allerede næsten mørkt - stenka gaar hurtigt til stedet, hvor han havde efterladt sine ting - han læsser det hele paa en stor grangren, surrer det fast og slæber næsten løbende sit læs hjem gennem det hurtigt faldende mørke - det er sagte begyndt at sne, og hans aande staar som røg om hovedet paa ham i kulden -

manja havde tændt et stort baal foran hytten, for at han ved skæret eller lugten lettere skulde kunne finde huset - hun sidder i døraabningen - "hej stenka" raaber hun stille, da hun ser ham komme - hans aande har lavet skægget om til en hel isbuket - han rækker hende den ene af urfuglene og den anden paa en krog udvendig paa huset, hvor to harer i forvejen hænger - "kaffe?" spør hun - "mens maden blir færdig" stenka tar sin snevaade skindjakke af, og sine støvler og strømper, og stikker de bare fødder i et par sutter af hareskind og varmer dem paa stenene omkring det aabne ildsted - "kaffen er stærk" smiler



manja - "drik!" hun sætter sig i en krog og plukker hurtigt fjerene af fuglen - "stenka, jeg har taget maarskindet" hun siger det tøvende og stille - stenka rejser sig og gaar ud med en smal pakke, som laa under hans leje -, cognac'en - manja viser ham en stor krukke - "den fik jeg for skindet - og saa disse her" hun peger paa to faarelaar - "jeg syntes, vi skulde have lidt godt - der er brombærsyltetøj i krukken" - stenka rejser sig fra sin kaffe - og uden at hans hænder rører hende, bider han hende let i den udstrakte haand - saa tar han smilende hendes hoved mellem hænderne -, springer ud og kommer tilbage med en vældig favn brænde og smider den paa ilden - den rejser sig som et lakrødt taarn og sender en gloende hede ud i rummet - "vi skal have fest - en vældig fest - hører du manja - en fest - i nat laver vi fest, fest, fest -!"

manjas øjne, kinder og mund breder sig ud i et smil af tyk fløjelsrød varme - "fest, stenka - ja" og stille begynder hun at forberede sig til festen - imens gaar stenka med en stor gryde ned til bækken og vasker fødder, ansigt og haar i det iskolde vand - urfuglen er stegt - kaffen færdig, og en fed suppe af kraaser staar dampende paa en sten, hvid af hede efter at have ligget i ilden - manja tar sit tøj af paa nær en nederdel af rødt lærred og gaar barbenet ud under en tynd gran, ryster den og svaler sin af ildskæret tørrede hud med sneen, der falder ned over hende fra granens grene - hendes farve er som frisktafbarkettræ, og levende og mat - hendes sorte haar er fyldt med duften af brændt gran, og dets egen duft er som et nyskudt dyrs - hendes øjne er blanke, og deres lys skifter som skovens lys - fra nattens sammenkrøbne sorthed til solopgangens forbijagende haler - og tilbage gennem dagens grønskarpe aarvaagenhed, oversaaet med skovens brune bankende ro - manja er ikke født her - hun er fra det store land med de lange bølgende sange - hvor hestene er fulde af værdighed og uro - hvor floder og kvinder tilbeder maanen, og mændenes angst for det ukendte gør dem hurtige og skæggede - de røde støvlers land - manja er fra landet i øst, hvor mysteriet har valgt at være jubel og dans, og hvor jordens knugende død vaager i natlige klager mod ubønhørlige og levende guder - manja var gaaet bort for at finde lykkelige mennesker, men hun vilde snart vende tilbage til de røde støvlers land - hun vidste det -

hun gaar atter ind i huset - tørrer sit haar ved ilden, binder det sammen i nakken med et sort baand, sætter sig i en krog og begynder at spise - stenka kommer tilbage med den store gryde



svingende i haanden og flasken med cognac - ingen af dem har spist siden morgenen - stenka sætter sig helt henne ved ilden med korslagte ben og roder op i sit vaade haair og skæg - manja sidder paa hug i sin krog med tallerkenen paa de bare knæ, gnavende paa en vinge - som stol har hun nogle hvidelammeskind- hun hviler ikke som folk, der er vant til at sidde i stole - hun tynger ikke - hun sidder med fødderne ogsaa - naar hun rejser sig, stiger hendes legeme hurtigt og lige op uden andre bevægelser - stenka friserer omhyggeligt sit nu næsten tørre haar og skæg - ilden sender lynsnare og slikkende skygger over hans ansigt - røgen, der kun langsomt trænger ud gennem det lille kolde hul i taget, trykker loftet midtvejs ned over gulvet - -

manja rækker stenka hans portion af fuglen - hun bøjer sig frem uden at flytte sig og støtter den ene haand foran sig - stenka tar fadet og griber samtidigt om hendes udstraktehaandledog kysser hurtigt alle hendes fingre en efter en - saa river han fuglen midt over og spiser sultent - manja er alleredefærdigog sidder med hagen i hænderne og betragter ham - stenka kaster sine afgnavede ben paa ilden og henter kaffegryden - hun sætter tallerknerne udenfor - til kaffen spiser de hver en stor kop brombærsyltetøj - saa begynder festen - manja nynner, vuggende med hovedet og de knyttede hænder - omkvædet paa sangen er kort latter, som hun understreger ved at slaa en haand mod hvert knæ - stenka skænker de tømte kaffekopper fulde af cognac - de tænder hver en cigar - i stille og mæt nydelse sidder de og stirrer i ilden, drikker og ryger - stenka bygger legende et kinesisk taarn af brændestykker overildstedet,hvis flammer hvæsende illuminerer det indefra - manja piller med tæerne i faareulden under sig - og smiler mod stenka

- naar hun smiler, løfter hun kun overlæben fra tænderne - mundvigene og underlæben er ubevægelige - hendes tænder er meget tykke - og korte - som tætte terninger af porcelæn -hendesøjne smiler mere end munden, og panden faar en rynke - de drikker skiftevis kaffe og cognac af kopperne - hver gang en drikker ud, fyldes koppen paany - den, der har drukket, rækker sin kop til den anden, som skænker - huset er kun oplyst af ilden - varmen er enorm, men de har kun ild om aftenen, og mærker det ikke -

stenka ryger meget hurtigt - efter cigaren stopper han to piber

- manja kan ikke stoppe selv - cognac'en farer rundt underhudenpaa dem - opad - kaffen faar deres hjærter til at snurre -



bunden i de tømte kopper er dækket af et tykt lag grums, som de slaar ud, før de skænker - manja stryger ned ad sin kjole og rejser sig - hendes fødder er smaa og høje - og brune - hun begynder sagte at synge en dans - stenka forstaar ikke ordene - sangen blir stærkere - højere - stenka lægger langsomt pibe og kop fra sig - og tar hendes ene haand - de danser - først haand i haand - til de har fundet takten - til rytmen har rigtig fat - saa tar de om hinanden og danser rigtigt - manja synger med øjnene næsten lukkede - hurtigere og hurtigere - stenka ser tavs paa hendes ansigt - gulvet er kun eet lag brædder - nogletommerfra jorden - det gynger sagte efter manjas bare fødder og stenkas bløde sutter - de danser længe - manja synger den samme sang om og om igen - ord, som siger det samme som melodien - langsomt blir hendes stemme svagere - hun synger højt oppe ligesom fra næseroden - saa skiller hun læberne, og sangen blir dyb og blød - saa atter højere - til den næsten er et melodisk og rytmisk udtrukket skrig - en del af dansen danser de bedre sammen end det øvrige - helt sammen - deres blikke gaar som stænger af følelser og liv forbi den andens øre og kind -

men helt forskelligt danser de - manjas dans er ligesom spredt, flagrende - dog er hendes bevægelser ikke store - men det er som om betydningen ligger langt bagved dem - som om de kun er løsrevne glimt fra en tordensky, der endnu er langt borte - hendes skridt er ikke selve dansen, hendes rytme heller ikke - sangen er nærmere ved - men der er en anden sang, som stenka hører i sin haand, som han ligesom har rakt dybt ind i en fjern og mægtig melodi - manjas melodi, som hendes urolige og dog sikre skridt ikke kan følge, som ingen dans i verden kan følge helt ud - stenka danser helt anderledes - det er samlet som eet dyr, en maar, en odder, en slange - stenka danser een tanke, een følelse ad gangen - danser den færdig og fortsætter med den næste - han kan holde op og begynde igen, hvor han slap - han kan blive ved, til han har danset, hvad der er at danse - stenkadansersit sinds perlebaand, den ene dag langt som en vej, den anden dag kort som en sang - stenka faar ro af at danse - og glæde af at føle roen komme - og brede sig i ham - for manja er det hver gang paany at betragte hele afstandens uhyggelige, urokkelige længde - hjemveens højtklagende vemod - hjemveen efter den evigt lige fjerne melodi, som er hendes hjærte,hendeshjemland - men atter og atter maa hun søge ud til uroen, danse sig i alt fald saa langt frem, at hun kan skimte den dybe



varme, hvoraf hun er kommet, som en rød solstribe paa horisonten -

- før de holder op med at danse, har de fundet et sted, hvor de er meget nær til hinanden - det er som om de begge staar med en arm paa hver side af stammen paa hver et højt træ ogtrækkeri hinandens hænder med brystet mod de ubønhørligestammer- og saa et kort øjeblik blir træer til kviste og stammernes øverste toppe bøjes sammen af deres arme - men stadig er de gyngende, susende, skillende stammer der - dog er de i dette korte øjeblik som vand, som luft, som intet - men de er der - imellem dem - trykket mod bryst og kind - og i dette korte øjeblik føler begge de dansende, at stammer, pæle, grænser ikke kan flyttes fra, hvor de staar, men at deres magt kan gøres lille og svag som aftenvind og faldende blade -

efter dansen sidder de to som før - skænker i igen og tænder en ny cigar - spiser mere syltetøj - isen i bækken nedenfor gir af og til et knald - sneen lister susende ned mellem granernes grene - der er en lille drive udenfor døraabningen som enbarrieremellem skoven og huset - ilden har grebet stenkas taarn og kaster en kort tid et gnistrende lys gennem røgen i stuen - stenene omkring ildstedet ser taageagtige ud af hede - manja er ligesom mindre nu -, det er som al hendes kraft har trukket sig sammen til en blok inde i hende efter dansen - musklerne i hendes kæber har mørke skygger - hendes øjne ser vidaabne ind i ilden - hun sidder paa sine hænder og over undersiden af hendes fødder, som ildskæret belyser, klemmer de korte tær sig ned, som om de med magt betvang en voldsom trang efter at udsige, hvad de vidste - der er for varmt nu - de lader ilden dø ud - stenka knapper sin skjorte op foran - saa ser han pludselig paa manja - "jeg vil fortælle dig historien om shojo, verdens drukkenbold" manjas spænding opløser sig i et udtryk af den største glæde - hun udstøder en lille latter - som en fugl, der letter - "ja" hun tar med hænderne under sine fødder, saa fingrene mødes, og hendes skuldre næsten rører ved knæene - "ja" hvisker hun, "ja - fortæl historien -"

IV. shojo

- stenka taler fra sin sjæls underste blomster - af og til er hans stemme snærrende og skarp som en agitators - saa atter som en, der hvisker en uendelig kostbar og farlig heramelighed mod et



øre, der om nødvendigt maa tvinges til at forstaa - ordene smuldrer hen - tonefaldet alene taler - manja maa anstrænge sig til det yderste for overhovedet at opfatte noget - og hele tiden er hans strejfende tale skødesløs, uvæsentlig - som om han tror fuldt og fast, at de ting, han fortæller, er saa store, saa stærke, at de umiddelbart maa trænge ind, ligegyldigt hvilke ord, der tumler over hans læber - som om disse store ting maatte træde frem, klare og utvivlsomme, alene paa grund af deres magt over den talende, selv om han talte om helt andre og mindre lysende emner - men manja er en god tilhører - først nærmer hun sig til hans mund, hvis læber næsten ikke bevæger sig - saa gaar hun længere, og hun sidder skælvende af iver bag ved ordenes arbejdende læber og tunge - hun kan lade dem gaa uænsede forbi sig - hun lytter til det, stenka siger, til det, han vil - lytter -, bare lytter - og arbejder - sig længere og længere ind - ind og igennem - til hun hører - nu hører hun - gennem en tom himmel kommer en regn af blanke meteorlysende kugler over hende - hendes sjæls hænder griber og griber -, samler ogsamler- og febrilsk gør hun hænderne fri for at kunne gribe, stadig gribe, gribe og samle - der er intet uden en langsom og tungt arbejdende mund et sted højt oppe - og disse store sejlende kugler, der blanke, skiftende i klare kølige farver, daler ned mod hendes aabne hænder - lægger sig omkring hende, forhænderneat ordne, betragte, tage - saadan er stenkas tøvende ord: "allerførst var shojo min mor - og gennem min barndom blev shojo min barndoms konge; sommetider var denne konge min ven, til andre tider min bitreste fjende, som det var mig umuligt at overvinde - hvor denne konge drog frem, var vejen paa den ene side kantet med knækkede lanser, afhuggede hjælmbuske, trompetfanfarer og lyden af store hestes trampen - og paa den anden side hørtes kvinders øresønderrivende skrig og graad - mænds forbandelser og tilfangetagnes ydmyge hyldest - shojo er et navn jeg fandt i skoven forleden dag - efter min barndom blev shojo min kammerat - min kammerat i hvis selskab jeg legede, spekulerede og sloges - min kammerat, som vidste mere om mig, end jeg om ham - og saa da jeg var blevet en 15 - 16 aar, (jeg naaede hurtigt denne alder), fandt jeg, at shojo fra kammerat var blevet min lærer - hans tanker og ord blev svære at forstaa - men jeg arbejdede, til det lykkedes - - shojo var nu en meget gammel mand - han maa have været mindst 50 aar ældre, end jeg dengang - en periode var han en gammel og vis jøde, hvis rolige, overlegne humor flydende og



fast løste mine 16-aarige indfiltrede knuder - og jeg sled og stræbte, til jeg kunde følge ham - og en tid var shojo en olding af min egen race - en hvidhaaret olding med en stor vorte paa næsen og en ro, der besejrede alt ondt - ogsaa ham lykkedes det mig at følge og forstaa - men da jeg var blevet 17 aar, saa jeg at hans ro var falsk, at oldingens sejr over ondskaben blot var alderdom - og shojo blev igen min jævnaldrende kammerat og ven - men en ven uden hensynsfuldhed, som førte mig ud i vanskeligheder og haard modgang - han, sho jo, havde sine egne veje, som han fulgte uden at tænke paa, at jeg, hans ven, maatte følge - uden at skænke det en tanke, at de veje, som for ham selv blot var hans, og for ham selvfølgelige, for mig blev en strid, der sled paa mit sind og forbrugte min ungdoms uprøvede kræfter - men altid gennem alle disse aar var shojo saadan, at han stod foran mig eller ved min side og pegede, og jeg saa ham og fulgte - men for hver gang jeg havde naaet det af ham udpegede, havde shojo umærkeligt skiftet udseende, varbleveten anden -

- og paa denne tid da jeg var sytten aar, skete det, at min kraft svigtede, at mine anstrengelser ikke slog til, og jeg ikke mere kunde følge min kammerat shojo - og i min svaghed omtydede jeg hans krav, forfalskede jeg hans ord - og jeg gik en skæv vej og til al modstand raabte jeg mod min ængstelige sjæl: det er saadan shojo vil - du maa gøre saadan - ser du da ikke at det er saadan, shojo vil, - og i lang tid efter dette gik alt godt for mig - min vej var lige, men shojos vej var ogsaa lige, og jo længere jeg gik, jo større blev afstanden og min egen angst - for hvert skridt, for hver kamp sejrede jeg over den dumhed, den skændsel, som jeg angreb - men min uklarhed, og det deraf kommende raseri, gjorde, at jeg efter hver sejr blandt de bekæmpede, de besejrede, de dræbte, fandt ogsaa megen sandhed, megen sand godhed - jeg opsøgte i mit voksende raseri, der nærmede sig vanvid stadig dumheden, skændslen - men jeg fandt den hver gang i borge hvor ogsaa sandhed og godhed havde søgt tilflugt - og staaende paa de rygende ruiner efter hver sejr, jeg ved raseriets mod havde vundet, fandt jeg hver gang ogsaa sandhed og godhed blandt de overvundne og dræbte -

- og saa en dag kom shojo til mig - han var nu en ung 22-aarig prins af sjælden skønhed - og han fortalte mig, at han maatte rejse - at hans moder dronningen ventede ham i sit slot mod syd - shojo var ikke vred - ikke bedrøvet - han blot sagde, at



han nu maatte rejse til sin moder, som ventede ham - først da anede jeg dunkelt, hvad der var sket - endnu forstod jeg intet, men mit stormende raseri var blevet ren angst - og i min sjæl var intet andet end angst - der fandtes ingen tanke, ingenbestemt,klar og artikuleret følelse, intet var tilbage i min sjæl uden denne angst, der lignede vanvid, mere end kamplysten og raseriet nogensinde havde gjort det - - - - "

- stenkas stemme er næsten ikke til at høre og uendeligtlangsomtfalder ordene fra hans mund - som løv saa let, at intet synes at kunne formaa det til at lande og tage fodfæste paa jorden, hvor det dog tilsidst vil lægge sig, som om det aldrig havde kendt anden plads - hviskende og dog fuldt hørbartfortsætterhan sin besynderlige beretning om shojo: "shojo er det menneske, jeg af alle har elsket højest - jeg har følt hans sjæl med mine hænder i vanmagt og rædsel - jeg har lidt mere med shojo, end med nogen anden, mere end jeg nogensinde har lidt for mig selv - og gennem hans hjerte saa jeg et baal af sejrende jubel, der gik gennem mine lukkede øjenlaag som sol - jeg hørte solens smæltende smil smælte jordens evige død og imægtigglæde føde nyt liv deraf - sommetider elskede jeg shojo, saa at jeg tvivlede om, at jeg var mig selv - og til andre tider kunde jeg frygte hans overmenneskelige strænghed som min egen undergang -

- tilsidst sagde shojo: nu har du kendt mig - jeg har gjort meget ondt i mit første liv og meget godt i mit andet liv, saadan som jeg skulde - og nu gaar jeg til de grønne haver med det milde lys og den evigt skiftende musik for at hvile hos min dronning, som venter mig der, iført den blaa og hvide dragt, som hører til hendes kærlighed - - " og stenkas stemme kan næppe anes, da han tilføjer: "og da shojo var gaaet fandt jeg detfrygteligste- jeg havde glemt alt, hvad jeg havde gjort gennem alle disse aar - at jeg end ikke vidste, hvem mine ofre var, eller deres antal, eller hvilken skæbne, der var blevet deres - kun forstod jeg, at jeg havde kæmpet for en sag, som intet var - at mit liv maatte have været sortere end nogens af alle dem, som jeg i tro paa mit store maal havde saaret og dræbt - og hvis helligste, jeg med rolig samvittighed havde skændet -

og hin nat fandt jeg, at maalet for hvilket jeg havde troet hvert offer billigt, havde været latterligt som gniernes kamp ommønter,som perversitetens spyt mod kærlighedens brand - jeg fandt, at jeg havde været en trofast og offervillig jesuit i min egen tjeneste, mens jeg troede, at vinde helgenkrone for en sag, som



var menneskehedens - for den nat er jeg shojo taknemmelig, mere end for alt i verden -"

det er blevet morgen og stenkas i forvejen lave mumlendestemmedør hen i uhørbar ensformighed - stenka sover med ryggen mod væggen og fødderne hængende over ildstedets kant -gløderneulmer sagte og manja rejser sig smilende -

snevejret er blevet snestorm - husets gavl er en skibsstævn, der sukkende pløjer sig vej frem gennem de rejsende driver og stormens isnende sus - døren er helt dækket af sne - lyset, som mat borer sig ind gennem en smal aabning mellem den ogvæggen,er mælket og blaat - der blir ingen sol idag - manjaskubbermed skulderen døren et par tommer udad og graver i sneen med et stykke brænde, til hun kan aabne lige saa meget, at hun kan klemme sig igennem - skoven har ligesom sluppet fodfæstet og hænger i armene paa stormen, og gynger langsomt frem og tilbage - den er stum og dens øjne er lukkede - skoven hviler og lader uvejret gøre med sig, hvad det kan - og det er ikke meget - skoven ved det, og vugger roligt som i søvne - den drømmer med de senede rødder, og krammer dem i drømmen haardt om jorden og dens klippeblokke - snestorm er ingenting for skoven - det er alligevel dens sovetid - skoven er for stor til at have fjender - eller til at kende dem - i dag lader dens herre, solen, den hvile - skoven kan hvile -, men den behøver ikke at hvile - paa havet og over sletterne er stormen det store raseri - for skoven er den noget i luften -

solen gaar igennem et øjeblik og siger, at i dag vil der intet ske - stormen vælter sine tusinder tons af sne ned overalt, solen er langt borte og tavs, og skoven fniser af og til i søvne, naar den føler den vidunderlige, æggende saft, der vender sig i devældigeubekymrede rødder under sne, jord og sten - manja smutter ud med en gammel frakke over hovedet oghenteren favn brænde - hun laver frisk ild, fylder en gryde med sne - snart er der lyst og varmt i hytten, der langsomt fyldes med duften af stærk kaffe - hun flaar en hare og gør den i stand, saa den er parat, naar sulten melder sig - med en tændt morgenpibe i munden gaar hun hen og begynder at rede den sovende stenkas haar - varsomt og blødt - naar kammen vil sætte sig fast, tar hun den forsigtigt ud og begynder igen - ind imellem bøjer hun sig med leende øjne og kigger nedefra op paa stenkas ansigt - han har talt længe - men hun ser, at han er ved at vaagne - saa rejser hun sig lydløst og gaar hen ved døren



han nu maatte rejse til sin moder, som ventede ham - først da anede jeg dunkelt, hvad der var sket - endnu forstod jeg intet, men mit stormende raseri var blevet ren angst - og i min sjæl var intet andet end angst - der fandtes ingen tanke, ingenbestemt,klar og artikuleret følelse, intet var tilbage i min sjæl uden denne angst, der lignede vanvid, mere end kamplysten og raseriet nogensinde havde gjort det - - - - "

- stenkas stemme er næsten ikke til at høre og uendeligtlangsomtfalder ordene fra hans mund - som løv saa let, at intet synes at kunne formaa det til at lande og tage fodfæste paa jorden, hvor det dog tilsidst vil lægge sig, som om det aldrig havde kendt anden plads - hviskende og dog fuldt hørbartfortsætterhan sin besynderlige beretning om shojo: "shojo er det menneske, jeg af alle har elsket højest - jeg har følt hans sjæl med mine hænder i vanmagt og rædsel - jeg har lidt mere med shojo, end med nogen anden, mere end jeg nogensinde har lidt for mig selv - og gennem hans hjerte saa jeg et baal af sejrende jubel, der gik gennem mine lukkede øjenlaag som sol - jeg hørte solens smæltende smil smælte jordens evige død og imægtigglæde føde nyt liv deraf - sommetider elskede jeg shojo, saa at jeg tvivlede om, at jeg var mig selv - og til andre tider kunde jeg frygte hans overmenneskelige strænghed som min egen undergang -

- tilsidst sagde shojo: nu har du kendt mig - jeg har gjort meget ondt i mit første liv og meget godt i mit andet liv, saadan som jeg skulde - og nu gaar jeg til de grønne haver med det milde lys og den evigt skiftende musik for at hvile hos min dronning, som venter mig der, iført den blaa og hvide dragt, som hører til hendes kærlighed - -"og stenkas stemme kan næppe anes, da han tilføjer: "og da shojo var gaaet fandt jeg detfrygteligste- jeg havde glemt alt, hvad jeg havde gjort gennem alle disse aar - at jeg end ikke vidste, hvem mine ofre var, eller deres antal, eller hvilken skæbne, der var blevet deres - kun forstod jeg, at jeg havde kæmpet for en sag, som intet var - at mit liv maatte have været sortere end nogens af alle dem, som jeg i tro paa mit store maal havde saaret og dræbt - og hvis helligste, jeg med rolig samvittighed havde skændet -

og hin nat fandt jeg, at maalet for hvilket jeg havde troet hvert offer billigt, havde været latterligt som gniernes kamp ommønter,som perversitetens spyt mod kærlighedens brand - jeg fandt, at jeg havde været en trofast og offervillig jesuit i min egen tjeneste, mens jeg troede, at vinde helgenkrone for en sag, som



manja vaagner - de ser paa hinanden og lytter mod dalen - det, som høres, er ikke dyr, ikke storm - langt nede høres en knækken af grene, som langsomt nærmer sig - det kan ikke være andet end menneskefødder - og ikke et, men flere, mange menneskers trampen - hvad er der for mennesker at søge i denne retning og i snestorm i en skov uden veje og stier? stenka rejser sig og gaar ud - hurtigt har han faaet skindjakken over ryggen og bøssen i haanden - dyret, som ser sin hule opdaget, flygter for at finde den indtrængende, før det selv er fundet og fanget - manja følger ham efter et par minutter - sneen er dyb og tung, og stadig nye lag farer frem mellem træerne og fylder mellemrummene mellem driverne - stenka har næppe gaaet 100 skridt -, og manja 10 -, da en forpustet stønnende skiløber staar foran dem - georg, en ung karl fra landsbyen - stakaandetfortællerhan, at der er kommet en direktør i en stor lukket bil, udelukkende for at besøge stenka - bonden smiler - stenka kan ikke være nogen anden, end den, der staar foran ham - stenka nikker tavst - han er fanget - der er intet at gøre - manjabetragterham rædselsslagen - nu hører de alle tydeligt, hvordan de tunge masende skridt langsomt kommer nærmere - bonden kaster et forsigtigt blik paa stenka - og sætter hænderne for munden og raaber mod stormen: "her! her! her! -" saa staar han genert smilende - i forhold til en direktør er stenka og han dog trods alt næsten forbundsfæller - men han ser paa stenka, at der er ingen vej udenom - det er for sent - et øjeblik endnu staar stenka - lammet - saa kommer der et haardt og frækt træk som et ryk over hans mund - manja fanger det - stenka vender sig roligt mod hende -: "i dag er det vor festdag - men vi kan ikke skyde ingeniør erik brandt -" stenka griner "men fest er fest, og storm er storm - og dig skal direktøren give champagne, saa du hører maanen og de tusind floder fra dit eget land - og festen er vor - kun vor -" stenka klemmer manjas haandled, som var det et bøsseløb - "det skal gaa -" hunnikkerstum - og næppe har hun hvisket sit skønne "du har ret", før direktøren ingeniør erik brandt fnysende af kulde og sne maser sig frem gennem sneen, lige imod dem - og bagved denne pelsklædte skikkelse dukker mere end trediedelen af landsbyen op - unge mænd, koner, børn - georg, skiløberen, indser, at de ikke har noget at gøre her - han vender sig opgivende mod erik brandt - ingeniøren gir ham en seddel og truer modflokken,der tøvende rykker nærmere og tilsidst stiller sig op tyve meter fra huset - sammen med georg trækker de sig skuffede



og modvilligt tilbage og vender hjem, udasede og gennemblødte, for at meddele den magre, men dog friskt duftende nyhed, at den mystiske stenka, ikke er nogen anden end hr. stenka fra ... -

landsbyens stemmer er forsvundet - og en hær af fodspor har stormen aandet paa og dækket med sit søvngivende tæppe af 1 meter sne - og som en pilgrim under peterskirkens kuppel træder den 30-aarige direktør erik brandt, bro- vej- oghavneentreprenør,ind i stenkas hus, bøjende sig under den lavedøraabning- med hinanden i haanden følger stenka og manja efter for at fuldføre deres afbrudte fest -

maaske læser erik brandt i deres ansigter noget om skovensafbrudtehvile, eller om en fest mellem to mennesker efter fire maaneders tavshed - eller -, og snarere, han er saa til randen fyldt af dette ene, dette, som han er kommet for, at han ikke kan vente med at tale, til han har faaet pelsen af - men stenka afbryder ham: "det er manja -" de to sætter sig - der, hvor hun før har plejet at sidde - stenka peger, at erik brandt kan sætte sig paa hans plads - manja har en flakkende uro i sine øjne - det er ikke noget med deres gæst - det er stenka -, hvad han vil gøre - hun sidder saa nær ved ham, at hun ikke kan se hans ansigt - han rækker hende en cigar og tænder en selv - "vi -", begynder han - men erik brandts bedende blik standser ham - siddende med den tunge sorte pels i skødet stirrer han ufravendt paa stenka - saa siger han med en for hytten alt for høj stemme: "du maa rejse med mig til ... -" og efter disse ord brister direktør erik brandt i graad - hulkende, fortvivlede faldertaarernened i pelsen - og imellem dem ligger løsrevne, ynkelige ord: "jeg er rig - jeg er gift - du maa -" stenka farer op og gir den grædende en drønende lussing - saa brøler han ind i erik brandts taarevædede, bortvendte ansigt: "ja - jeg skal - rejse med - dig -" som ved et trylleslag ophører graaden - erik brandt rejser sig hurtigt, griber stenkas haand - men stenka gør sig fri og siger kort: "nej - du skal tie stille -" hans øjne falder paa lejet, hvor han to minutter før havde siddet ved siden af manja - skindet er bart - manja er ikke i hytten - han kaster et roligt blik paa sin gæst og gaar ud - han stiller sig paa den store flade træstub, hvorfra han i gaar havde set solen staa op - hans legeme er en eneste anspændt lytten - saa raaber han, vendende sig mod nord, mod skoven: "husk festen!" - et hviskende "ja" siver gennem snestormens mælkede væg - og langsomt gaar stenka tilbage til huset -



men paa sin vej gennem sneen -, langs bjærgets kant, mod nord, tænker manja smilende paa historien om shojo -

i eksprestoget finmarken - ... sidder direktør erik brandtsammenmed stenka -

erik brandt taler - taler og taler uden ophold - men eftersom hans tale ikke indeholder andet og mere, end de korte hulkende udbrud, der faldt mellem hans taarer paa den sorte pels i stenkas hus, vil vi foreløbig lade den upaaagtet - - og i stedet for et øjeblik lytte til, hvad stenkas stædige tavshed kan have at svare og indvende -

"erik brandt er slut - død og færdig - han er intet mere at regne med - nu har jeg frælst ham tre gange - og hver gang uden virkeligt resultat - hver gang jeg har ført ham op i taarnet, hvorfra han kunde se sig selv og verden, sine virkelige fjender og de farer, der alene er at regne med - hver gang han har staaet i taarnet og set alverdens kræfter brydes og kæmpe med hinanden, har han svimlet og bedt om naade - hver gang han har set, at der kun er een kraft, der er mægtigere end alle andre tilsammen, har han frygtet underkastelsen ogdelagtighedenspris, der dog er saa latterlig lille, naar man ejer mønten, den skal betales med -, og det gør hvert menneske - og i højere grad, jo senere det har haft lykken at komme til verden - nu kan han gaa - han kan gaa til den store forbandede hob - den store hob af absolut haabløse - aah - disse stinkende gamle sjæle - men nu ved jeg, at vi maa negligere dem - gøre vort regnestykke op, som om de ikke eksisterede - de eksisterer jo faktisk ikke - lenin gjorde sit regnestykke - og fik ret - de kunde negligeres - de kunde ikke gøre modstand - og de kunde ikke overbevises - hverken om det ene rette eller om det modsatte - de havde simpelthen ikke overbevisningens evne - de er det værdiløse pulverresultat af kampen mellem de store akser og de store lejer, som disse arbejder i - paa den ene eller den anden maade maa hele denne klump elimineres bort - stenkas tanker gør et vældigt spring -, toget svinger frem ogtilbageaf fart -, erik brandt taler og taler -, og stenkas tanker kører videre der, hvor de er sat af efter springet, som en hær af traktorer -

jeg tror ikke paa kunstnernes hævden af det dummeundskyldendegenerationsprincip - at hver tid skulde have sine kunstnere, sine politikere og videnskabsmænd, der blot har at opfylde den tids krav og derefter dø, for at lade helt andre



opgaver opstaa for nye mennesker at løse - det er de gamle, der ser, at de ikke har naaet, hvad de vilde -, og de unge, der indser deres egen svaghed (hvilket er dobbelt svaghed) og paa forhaand opgir - siden Kristi død har alle kunstnere, alle forskere villet det samme -, det ene og samme - men alle er de enten gaaet en forkert vej -, eller de har savnet den fornødne styrke - det er og blir umuligt at skabe, fremtvinge nye, rigtige mennesker, saalænge mennesker er nødt til at leve undersamfundssystemer,som de nuværende - det er ikke det enesamfundssystem,der er værre eller bedre end det andet - det er hele det store fælles skema for alle samfund, der er haabløst, satanisk ondt -, idiotisk - en stor mand kan danne femhundrede nye, rigtige mennesker - de er der -, de staar færdige og frie, som de skal være - og hvis de ikke er titaner af sjælskraft og fysik, vil samfundskolosserne dog gradvis vride dem tilbage, bøje dem, bage dem om i den gamle stupide form -

det er umuligt at udrette noget ved at arbejde med enkelte, med individer - man kan, det viser sig, og har altid vist sig, man kan skabe mennesker - men disse kan umuligt staa, naar de blir sat ud i stupiditetens glatte glidende skidt - og at gaa den anden vej er ogsaa haabløst - du kan ikke ændre, selv detallerringestefra grunden, samfundsmæssigt, uden i forvejen at have frigjort de vældige skjulte krav hos menneskeheden, der ene vil være i stand til at bære en saadan verdensomformning, som selv den mindste virke1ig konsekventeændringsbestræbelseøjeblikkelig vilde resultere i - ja, disse latente krav om fornuft og retfærdighed i universel maalestok, hvis fond af energi, nu bundet, først frigjorte vil virke som en naturkatastrofe af verdensformat, selv paa de mest forudseende -, disse krav vil uundgaaeligt virke imod dine hæderligste anstrængelser,saalængede er uden sprog, uden naturligt afløb, saalænge de trykkes ned til blot en undertrykt uartikuleret destruktionsdrift - der findes kun eet eneste vindue, der ufejlbarligt viser rigtigt og altid staar aabent - du kan ikke nu skabe de nyemennesker-, for de vil dø - du kan ikke ændre samfundene (fra grunden straks - al anden vej er paa forhaand haabløs), for de gamle kræfter vil kvæle dig -, og de nye, der endnu ligger som uaabnede og ukendte gaver, kan ikke støtte dig - men dette kan du gøre -: du kan arbejde paa at give mæle til de vældige, naar først frigjorte, saa ubetvingelige, krav, der (endnu bundne) æder af livskraften hos alle levende - du kan raabe: se, hvad I



gør -! hvad I, I, som dog kaldes mennesker, finder jer i - se, hvordan I kunde leve - se alt, hvad der findes i jer - ser I ikke, at I kun bruger en tusindedel af jeres kraft -, og at I,saadansom alt er, ikke kan bruge mere -SE-SE-SE-! dette kan du gøre -

lær mennesker at tale - lær dem at udtrykke, ikke det, som man har bildt dem ind, er vigtigst for dem, men lær dem at udtrykke imellem sig det i dem, som kræver og længes efter et virke - 1igt liv for hver enkelt at leve, en virkelig strid for hver enkelt at kæmpe, den eneste strid, der er, og nogensinde kan blive, deres egen -, deres egen i aller dybeste forstand - som det er nu, gaar hvert enkelt menneske rundt og tror sig ene i verden om længselen, om kravet - der findes intet sprog til at aabenbare det store fællesskab - intet sprog til at udsige det, som fylder hvert menneskes inderste selv, og som alene er sand virkelighed - giv sproget, talens gave - lær menneskene at sige, blot de ligegyldigste ting paa et sprog, der kan udtrykke alt -, og de vil, alle somen, øjeblikkelig se, hvortil etsaadantsprog, en saadan gave er ment - hvad der skal siges,behøverdu ikke at bekymre dig om - det findes, stærkt, sundt og levende i dem alle - ubrugt, farligt og herligt - flyt denne, den første hindrende sten, og løgnen vil skride som en søjle af sand, bygget af et barns hænder - og alt det gamle vil være glemt og uendeligt fjernt for det store og vidunderlige, som hvertmenneskevil opdage i sig selv, og i alle andre - naar de enkelte ser, at de er alle, der endnu lever, da vil verdensstupiditeten dø - dø af en banal forkølelse eller tandpine - verdensstupiditetenssidstemiddel -, nu eneste effektive vaaben, er de skærme, den har sat mellem de enkelte mennesker -, og som faar dem til at tro paa ensomhedens løgn - stumhedens brændende feber -, som blot er den verdensstupiditetens indsmigrende, i hemmelighedbønfaldendekosmetik, den lægger over menneskene, menneskene, dens største fare -, for at de skal tro sig være blevet skønne, som de i forvejen var -, for at de ikke skal kende hinanden - gør dette - find kravet, som er hos alle, og giv det evnen til at udtrykke sig - og dit arbejde vil ikke blive din generations idealisme - dit arbejde vil, hvis du har den fornødne kraft og det fornødne klarsyn (hvilket du aldrig ved, før dit liv er endt, og endt efter at være tilbragtidenne kamp -, den enesteværdige,indtil den er vundet) -, dit arbejde vil gøre (eller medvirke til at gøre) jorden til det paradis, som den er ment som -, det paradis, som vi aldrig til fulde har kendt - men, som vi dog alle



aner maa være vort eneste rette og naturlige hjem - som vi alle i vore højeste, stærkeste og mest tilfredsstillende øjeblikke har troet os skimte glansen af - det er de øjeblikke, der burde være vor daglige opildner, naar vore krav vil lade sig fange inøjsomhedenstrætte garn - i de øjeblikke alene ved vi, sikkert, konkret og utvivlsomt, hvad det er, vi kæmper for, lider for og længes imod, og altid har længtes imod - hvis du er den, der kan dette og skal gøre det, da vil ditarbejdeblive en revolution, i hvis skær alle tidligere vil virke som blide og sentimentale kærtegn - dit arbejde vil blive det, som alle ærlige forskere, alle trofaste kunstnere, alle vaagne, alle virkeligt gode, siden romerrigets undergang forgæves har arbejdet paa - den lenin, som døde 1924 var blot en model af den lenin, som maa komme - den kristus, som blev korsfæstet for denne -, samme sags skyld, vil ikke blive den sidste - naar HAN kommer, vil hvert menneske, hvert barn, føle sig som den Rette, som den, der har gjort verden til det, som den altid har villet være, og indtil da altid trods alt har drømt om at blive - ingen er udvalgt, men alle, alle er kaldede: -

naaet saa langt indfanges stenkas ører af ordstrømmen, der sprøjter fra hjørnepladsen, hvor erik brandt sidder - en rigtig skovlatter faar stenkas kinder til at rødme - det er ikke erik brandts ord - dem har han ikke hørt - det er en blomstring i hans eget bryst - en blomstring, ikke anemoneblid ogviolduftende-, men haard og brutal og dog kærlighedsbedøvende og herlig - hans næsebor fanger en duft, herlig som saften af raat kokød - og han ser for sig tusinder af byer brænde paa vældige altre, paa hvis kant er skrevet: Et Nyt Liv Er Begyndt, Hver Den, Som Tøver Skal Blive Et Glædesoffer Til Det Ny Liv - - erik brandt taler sagte: "jeg har aldrig kunnet tale - og man kan vel ikke forlange, at andre skal forstaa en, naar man intet siger - jo du har forstaaet mig -

først var det min far - han undertrykte alt i mig - og jeg kunde ikke sige ham, at det var alt blødt og fint i mig, han traadte paa, hver gang, vi mødtes - saa var det else - hun frygtede og hadede min ensomhed - hun kunde ikke se, at min trang til tavshed og til at være alene, blot var en kamp for at finde de ord, de fagter, der skulde sige hende alt -, der skulde vise hende fuldt ud, helt ind igennem min sjæl, hvordan og hvorfor jeg elskede hende - og hendes frygt for min lukkethed blev en tyk mur - og nu tilsidst min rigdom, mit arbejde - mit arbejde, som



dog trods alt, til det sidste havde været helt mit eget -, ogsaa det blev en uhændig uformelig klump -, en drøm, som jeg ikke kunde magte, ikke udnytte, ikke forme -" erik brandts stemme er melodisk og dannet - behagelig - men hans ord er som et barns hjælpeløse klynken -: "nu har mit liv trykket sig sammen om mig, saa jeg ikke kan vende mig -, ikke kan finde noget som helst for bare grums og mørke - nu ved jeg ikke engang, hvorfor jeg skulde røre mig, hvorfor jeg skulde tale - du har frælst mig tre gange -, fræls mig igen - sig mig, hvad jeg skal gøre - du maa vide det, om nogen ved det -"

atter glider skovlatteren over stenkas ansigt - skovlatter har intet med en almindelig skov at gøre - den kommer fra stenkas skov - og vender tilbage derind som en givende og frugtbar regn og gør rødder og stammer blanke som nye vokslys - stenka griner og svarer -: erik - du er erik brandt - jeg kan sige dig, hvad du skal gøre - selv kan du intet gøre mer - erik brandt selv er død - men du " skal", det er det eneste, du kan nu, og det skal du - du skal være en finger mellem mine overbebyrdede virkehænders tusinde fingre - tro! tro! - og du vil maaske blive frælst paa en anden maade - dine egne krav er færdige - gaa nu ind under mine kravs ubrydelige strænghed - ogsvigterdu denne gang, er det din sidste, absolut sidste død -" stenka smiler - at smile er hans egentlige, virkelige udtryksmiddel - og erik brandt nikker - og hvisker med stive læber: "ja" - uigenkaldeligt - erik brandts strid er tabt - den findes ikke mere

- og det er ikke ny strid, nyt liv, han har søgt - han har søgt frælse - nu findes kun stenkas usynlige maal -

toget gynger, duver og slingrer - bremser, og hviner i bremser og fjedre - standser og holder - medpassagererne skifter - ved en lille station stiger en gammel kone ind i kupeen, hvor stenka og erik brandt sidder - hun er helt hvidhaaret og har en tyk græsgrøn kjole paa - hendes hænder lægger sig klogt og roligt i skødet - hendes ældede ansigt er som et dyr, der hviler, men dog husker farerne, og som har fundet modet i at kendefrygtensaarsag - i samme øjeblik stenka ser hende, forandres hans udtryk, saa man næsten maa tro det er en anden mand, man har foran sig - men erik brandt lægger ikke mærke til det - han sidder foroverbøjet med hagen i de opadvendte haandflader og albuerne støttet mod knæene - han har ikke forstaaet, hvad stenka har sagt - og han bryder sig ikke om det - den ro han føler nu, har han ikke følt i flere aar - han har ladet sig synke

- endelig har han naaet bunden - det er ham nok, at stenka har



givet ham følelsen af, at han ikke kan komme længere ned - og at der synes at være en slags mening, selvom han ikke nuformaarat gribe den - pludselig hvisker stenka med ganske svag stemme: "erik, hvad jeg lige har sagt dig, er, at hvidt ikke er sort, at den fattige ikke er rig - det var alt -"

- saa falder hans blik atter paa den gamle kone overfor ham - hurtigt tar han sit cigaretetui op og rækker hende det - "De ryger, ikke sandt?" den gamle smiler: "det er saa længe siden, jeg har røget, at jeg næsten ikke kan huske, hvordan det er - mine børn synes ikke en gammel kone skal ryge - men det synes De aabenbart -" - hun tar ubehjælpsomt en cigaret ud, og stenka tænder den for hende - den gamle vil sige noget, men da hun ser, at stenka allerede har sat sig tilbage i sædet, og nu ser ud af vinduet med et fraværende og træt udtryk, tar hun sig i det

- erik brandt er ligesom vaagnet og betragter forbavset konen, der ryger med smaa korte drag som en ganske ung pige der [aldrig har] røget før -



kammerater!

- en kunstner, som ikke er revolutionær, er ikke kunstner - han er alle virkelige kunstneres lumskeste og farligste fjende - hans er forræderens og spionens rolle -, forræderen og spionen, som indenfor alle andre virkefelter øjeblikkelig dømmes tilskændselenstilintetgørelse, saasnart masken er revet fra hansbedrageriskeøjne og mund - den revolution, som er kunstnerens, er ikke brødets - brødets revolutionære er hans selvfølgeligekampfæller,men paa et ham uvedkommende omraade - hans maal er at skabe mennesker, som fuldt ud er i stand til at tilgodegøre sig frugterne af disse hans kampfællers resultater - de rydder, skaber plads, aabner en menneskeværdig jord -, hans opgave er at danne de mennesker, der værdigt og frigjorte først gennem hans arbejde blir aabne for den frugtbarhedens varme, som brødets revolutionære har beredt dem -

- der er overproduktion af varer, men ikke der, hvor varerbehøvesog ikke af de slags, der trænges til - og -, eller men, hvor mærkeligt det end lyder, der er en skrigende mangel (indtil videre uden lyd) paa mennesker - de, som er, kan af naturlige grunde ikke vandre paa jorden evigt - og nye fødes kun i et forsvindende faatal - og endnu besynderligere: de fødes, vokser op, lever og dør paa steder, ingen besøger; deres virkefeltindskrænkestil et latterligt minimum af slæbende, tyngendedødsmasser- resultatet af deres kæmpende, pinefulde liv blir klare lysende blomster, hvis straaler sluges og udviskes af etkæmpemørkeuden dybde og uden bund -

i forhold hertil er den materielle verden all-right, næsten venlig og god - jordens fortvivlede situation er, at der ingen findes til at frugtbargøre den, forløse den, puste ild i de evige, nu stumpt sørgende gløder - jorden behøver lige nu mennesker, derrepræsenterernoget, der symboliserer noget - men noget, der ikke er vagt og blødt som skum - noget, der staar, og blir staaende gennem gode og onde tider som træer og fjælde - og ikkeløsrevneindivider, men befolkningslag og nationer - situationen er blevet saadan, at vi ikke kan skærpe kravene til at fordre lys og overvældende godhed og frugtbarhed - vi maatte juble, om vi bare kunde øjne en flok djævle, hvis djævelskhed var



naturlig, levende og ubøjelig -, hvis maal var absolutte og udiskutable

- af saadanne kunde der skabes mennesker - fjældet er fjæld - du spør ikke hvorfor -, dine medmennesker er det eller det - dit krav om begrundelse er berettiget, fordi de ligesaa godt kunde ha' været noget tredie, fjerde eller femte - de var tomme - og tvunget af et overmægtigt samfund fyldte de sig af posen, der kunde kaldes unødvendighedens, tilfældighedens pose - og deres valg er intet valg - de var ikke affordret noget valg - deres greb i posen er ikke definitivt, uigenkaldeligt - prøv at kræve det bestemte, det reelle, det virkelige - og du vil finde, at vejen til mavernes og hjærternes mæthed er kort og gældende for dem alle -

hos et skaldyr er dyret det samme, det konstante, og skallen det skiftende - for de til fortvivlelse bragte mennesker nu er det skallen, sneglehuset, der skiftende fyldes med skiftendemæthedssurrogater- menneskehedens uvished og fortvivlelse ertragisk,fordi den er saa forbandet berettiget - og ingen enkelt kan alene hjælpe her - ikke din bedste ven kan du hjælpe - ikke din højest elskede - af intet kan intet blive - ikke med venskab - ikke med hellig kærlighed - her er ikke tale om overmenneske og ikke overmenneske, om genier kontra idioter - dintjenestepige,som er og blir og (forudsætter vi) ikke kan være og blive andet end tjener under en herre - hun er maaske virkelig, realiter det, hun er - hun er tjenestepige, og maaske endda den absolutte, utvivlsomme tjenestepige x - som kun kan være dette og denne - og som altid i al evighed vil fylde sin reelle plads i verden som tjenestepigen x og ingen anden - her er konventions- og samfundsbegreber som beskedenhed og ærgerrighed uklarhedskilder - du er den, du er - ingenidiotiskmeningsløskamp opad eller nedad kan gøre dig til andet end det - en falsk etikette resulterer blot i ubeføjede krav eller ubrugt kraft - og selve kampens haabløshed gør dig blot delagtig i den dødens tragik, som nærmer sig, stadig rykker nærmere, og som ikke den blodigste verdenskrig eller det brutaleste og fasteste diktatur kan forhale et sekund -

- hver idé, hver formskarakter kan kun i een kombination af andre former og andre følelser give hele sin sjæl -, hele sin betydning - naar en saadan kombination opstaar, er verden et kunstværk rigere - kun gennem denne ene situation kan en ny realitet opstaa, en bestaaende manifestere sin existens - ogsaadanogsaa med mennesker -



de bestaaende samfund nu (mere eller mindre, men dog alle) gør det saa vanskeligt for de nulevende mennesker, der erunderlagtderes omsorg, at indtage den plads (for hver enkelt kun een eneste), der er deres og kun deres - den plads, hvor deres betydning er uomtvistelig, den plads, hvor netop det bestemte menneske er absolut nødvendigt (for alle andre og det selv) og uundværligt - samfundssystemer, der gør det lettere for envognstyrerat blive professor end vognstyrer, og forhindrer tusinder af sømænd i at sejle for at stikke dem gadefejerens kost ihaanden-, saadanne samfundssystemer er de reelle kunstneresuforsonligstefjender - den kunstner, som ikke indser dette faktum, og indretter sig derefter, har automatisk mistet sin betydning for verden - selv om han (eller hun) derved faar lejlighed til at leve i 100 aar - og frem for alt: en saadankunstnervirksomheder direkte rettet mod alle andre kunstneres (hans eget inklusive) arbejde og sjæls frelse - og han burde brændemærkes med den frafaldnes lysende skændselsmærke - - en verdens- og samfundsordning, der gennemfører denminutiøsespecialisering, der ene kan give en mening til hvert eneste menneskeliv og give den enkle tilfredsstillelse ogverdensbetydningsom et gennemført livs strabadser med rette kan gøre krav paa -, kun en saadan samfundsordning kan en virkelig kunstner gøre til sit ideal - og den som nægter at acceptere dette (uendelig fjærne, men eneste værdige) maal - hans skæbne skal drukne som djævelens suk i erkeenglenes brusende sang - maaske er det et vigtigt organ, et instinkt vigtigt paa liv og død, som menneskene har glemt at anvende, har ladet ubrugt for længe - et instinkt af samme art, som det, der faar rovdyret til at jage og edderfuglen til at dykke - og planten til at gro kun der, hvor jorden er den rette - et instinkt uden falskhensynsfuldhed,der med sikkerhedens ro peger og ved: her og ikke der - her og ingen andre steder skal netop mit liv ligge - vi vil et samfund for alle mennesker, undtagen de golde, de snyltende, de indifferente - lad os frygte sygdommen mere end helbredelsen!



nogle kritiske bemærkninger om psykoanalyse

Nu "i vor oplyste tid", hvor man opfinder patenterede metoder til løsning af alle praktiske saavel som teoretiske spørgsmaal: Lynlaase og lilleputautomobiler, har man naturligvis ogsaaopdageten maade, hvorpaa alle psykologiens før saa vanskelige problemer let og hurtigt kan løses: Psykoanalysen.Egentligturde psykoanalysens resultater være af alt for tvivlsom karakter til at fortjene større opmærksomhed fra denvidenskabeligepsykologis side end andre metoder, hvis fordele ganske vist ikke er saa talrige, men til gengæld saa meget mere "solide" og tilforladelige. Men da psykoanalysen paa grund af de mange populære fremstillinger af den for mange staar som et symbol for hele den moderne eksakte psykologi, kunde det maaskeinteresserenogle at se den belyst fra et psykologisk synspunkt.

Ved første øjekast har denne metode kun een uheldig egenskab, nemlig den, at den mener at kunne løse alle knuderne. Man skal bare analysere; det kan enhver fatte. Sætter man saa psyko - foran, bliver de, der ikke forstod, ganske vist heller ikke forstaaende, men i alt fald overbeviste. Tilbage bliver de helt umulige, der hverken kan forstaa eller vil lade sigoverbevise.Vi vil nu se lidt paa, hvordan en af disse ser paapsykoanalysenstanker, saadan som dr. Næsgaard har fremstillet dem for os i sin bog om psykoanalyse.

Det, en psykolog først af alt vil fæste sin opmærksomhed paa, naar han staar overfor en fremstilling af de psykoanalytiske ideer, er vel disses hævden af det ubevidstes store betydning for menneskers handlinger og psykiske dispositioner. I og for sig er denne antagelse ikke noget, der først er fremkommet med psykoanalysen. Den videnskabelige psykologi har længe været klar over, at de ubevidste handlinger var langt talrigere end de, vi foretager med bevidsthed, og at handlinger, der til en vis tid var bevidste, under andre omstændigheder kan bliveubevidsteog omvendt. Psykoanalytikerne lægger derimod særlig vægt paa, hvad de kalder "ubevidst sjæleliv". Hvad deforstaarherved, staar vist de færreste rigtig klart. Sædvanlig vil man vel ved "sjæleliv" eller psykiske fænomener forstaa det



"bevidste" i modsætning til det ubevidste liv hos et menneske, altsaa menneskets rent fysiologiske virksomhed. Til dato har baade fysiologer og psykologer vist været enige om, at derforegaaren hel række processer baade hos dyr og mennesker, hvoraf dog kun en del er bevidste. Nu møder vi atter denne i mine øjne uholdbare antagelse om en "underbevidsthed" (ubevidst sjæleliv) hos psykoanalytikerne, der dog mere end at benytte den som det videnskabelige hjælpebegreb, den muligvis kunde være, anvender den som en slags asylumignorantiae.Hverken eksistensen af denne underbevidsthed, hvoraarsagernetil en mængde forskellige forhold henlægges, ellernødvendighedenaf dens antagelse er endnu bevist. (Denne antagelse grunder sig, hvad vi ikke vil gaa ind paa her, paa densandsynligvisuholdbare hypotese om eksistensen af psykiske "genstande"). Hvis psykoanalytikerne som underbevidsthed tænkte sig noget i retning af fysiologiske processer, som f. eks. vissenerveprocesser,der under givne omstændigheder kan være ledsaget afbevidsthed,men som i foreliggende tilfælde ikke er det, vilde det jo være i høj grad stemmende med virkeligheden og i allehenseenderfornuftigt; kun er det ikke helt let at faa det ud af deres egne fremstillinger. Under alle omstændigheder kunde man jo med god grund beklage sig over, at de indfører en saa uklar terminologi. De benytter her begreber, som man i forvejen bruger som betegnelser for helt andre fænomengrupper; og det kan jo ikke andet end øge det uheldige ved dette valg af termer, at disse ogsaa ellers er meget omtvistede.

Denne førnævnte opfattelse af begrebet "ubevidst sjæleliv" eller underbevidsthed synes mig at være den eneste, som giver nogen mening. Enhver anden, som man kunde forestille sig, maa, saa vidt jeg kan se, ende i uhjælpelige selvmodsigelser. Deforeliggendekendsgerninger fører ikke paa nogen maade hen imod antagelsen af et saadant, direkte uiagttageligt fænomen, og det er forøvrigt tvivlsomt, om det kan have nogen som helst heuristisk betydning.

Ogsaa et andet forhold forekommer mig ret uklart. Dr.Næsgaardsynes nemlig her ganske at forveksle psykoanalysens effektivitet overfor hvad han kalder fejlbygninger, med dens (eventuelle) brugbarhed som psykologisk metode. Et tydeligt eksempel paa dette findes pag. 28-29, hvor forf. omtaler og beskriver en "fejlbygning", som blev hævet ved anvendelse af psykoanalyse. Hvad selve fejlbygningen bestod i, er i denne



sammenhæng uvæsentligt (og fremgaar vel ogsaa tildels af det følgende). Hvad der derimod er meget vigtigt, er, at forf. afslutter beskrivelsen af fejlbygningen saaledes: "Heri laagrundentil opkastningen af kold mad. Saasnart detteaarsagsforholdblev oplyst, kunde han nemlig1taale at spise al slags kold mad uden at have den ringeste trang til at kaste op". Forf. begrunder altsaa sin opfattelse, at "grunden laa heri" med, at "patienten", efter at denne var blevet oplyst om "aarsagsforholdet",", blev helbredet for fejlbygningen Men det kan jo dog umuligt være et kriterium for analysens "sandhed", atpatientenbliver helbredet ved den; og det faar man absolutindtrykaf, at dr. Næsgaard mener. Helbredelsen bestaar jo, saa vidt jeg har forstaaet, i, at patienten bliver overbevist om sagens sammenhæng. Men sagens sammenhæng bliver han overbevist om af psykoanalytikeren (eller nervelægen), hvisopfattelseaf denne sammenhæng vel muligvis kunde være forkert. Endvidere bliver vedkommende patient, efterpsykoanalytikerensopfattelse, helbredet, naar han blot tror fuldt og fast paa den forklaring, han faar af psykoanalytikeren, hvad enten denne i og for sig er rigtig eller ej. Det væsentligste for helbredelsen er vel (ifølge psykoanalytikernes egne opfattelser), at patienten føler sig overbevist om, at den forklaring, han har faaet, er den rigtige; men dette forhindrer ikke, at den kan være fuldstændig forkert. Denne fejltagelse er antagelig opstaaet ved, atpsykoanalytikerneprøver paa at benytte en (hvor frugtbar, ved jeg ikke) psykiatrisk metode overfor psykologiske spørgsmaal.

Endvidere er, efter min mening, grundlaget for forklaringerne af flere af de fejlbygninger (i det følgende eksempel er det en saakaldet "fortalelse"), som forf. omtaler, i alt fald ofte, meget usikkert. Saaledes i tilfældet paa pag. 51, hvor "præsidenten for rigsdagen" skulde have sagt: "Hermed er rigsdagen lukket", medens hans hensigt var at erklære den for aabnet, fordi han hellere havde set, at dette rigsdagsmøde ikke var blevet holdt. Selvfølgeligt er det muligt, at dr. Næsgaards (eller den af ham anførte) forklaring er rigtig, men man savneruvilkaarligtbeviserne herfor.

Ogsaa mange af de drømmetydninger, som forf. beskriver,synesmig noget usikre. Jeg vil tillade mig at citere et afsnit med en af disse drømmetydninger, da jeg synes, det er typisk forpsykoanalytikernesmaade at foretage den slags operationer (se pag.

1Udhævelsen foretaget af mig.



91): "En meget ivrig drømmetyder drømte følgende drøm: "Der er faldet vildænder ned i skorstenene paa de helsingørskeejendomme,og ejerne samler disse ænder ind til eget forbrug. Kommunaldirektøren holder imidlertid paa, at denne ekstrafordel skal beskattes. Jeg protesterer og hævder, at det kan man ikke. Direktøren fastholder dog, at man bør skrive til ministeriet om det. Et sted paa bordet ser jeg et blyantskrevet concept med direktørens skrift. Personalet og jeg selv ses utydeligt sidde ved smaa brunmalede skoleborde og gnave skrog af de stegte vildænder, som vi gemmer paa hylder under bordene. Bag en stor oplyst rude i den ene væg ser jeg to kvinder (rengøringskoner),der vistnok rækker andeben til en ung kontorist, som jeg har haft paa kontor en gang for nogen tid siden"". Dette var selve drømmen, vel at mærke saadan, som vedkommende "meget ivrige drømmetyder" har husket og opfattet denbagefter.Nu vil vi anføre dr. Næsgaards forklaring af denne drøm for at vise, hvor meget en psykoanalytiker kan faa ud af dette for andre "udenforstaaende" forvirrede sammensurium af ord og sætninger:

"Drømmeren har ofte ønsket sig et "ben", og han har tidligere haft et ben, der blev taget fra ham af politiske grunde. Den unge kontorist, som kvinderne rakte ben til, var netop paa det kontor, hvor drømmeren havde sit ben Denne kontorist ligner en anden ung mand, i hvis hus drømmeren havde været den foregaaende dag. Vildænderne minder om en kile, idetdrømmerengaar ud fra, at det er vildænderne og ikke vildgæssene, der flyver i kile. Denne kile vilde han sammen med andre drive ind i det politiske flertal i kommunalbestyrelsen. Skolebordene stammer fra en samtale om en slægtnings børn, der gaar i skole, og hvis forhold blev drøftede sammen med en kendt skolemands optræden som politiker. Der havde ogsaa været tale om, at den ene af de to kvinder kunde trække stemmer paa den politiske liste, nemlig saadanne "folk som tante Vilhelmine". Denne kvinde ligner hende, og navnet Vilhelmine kan minde om vildænder".

Det her citerede behøver vist ingen kommentar; det taler for sig selv. Men skulde den her anførte tydning virkelig være den eneste mulige? Og hvorfor?

Meget væsentlig er forfatterens brug af ordet seksuel i meget forskellige betydninger. Det kan dog ikke andet end bidrage til stor uklarhed, naar man, som dr. Næsgaard, afvekslende benytter dette ord som betegnelse for, hvad man i almindelighed



vilde forstaa ved seksuel, nemlig nærmest lig kønslig ellerkønsiandre forbindelser, som kønssygdomme, kønsforhold o. s. v., og som term for alle de (mere eller mindre forskelligartede)fænomengrupper,som Freud ofte sammenfatter under dennebenævnelse.Overhovedet forekommer den altomfattende indflydelse, som psykoanalytikerne (og dr. Næsgaard) tilskriver detseksuelleliv (i dette ords egentlige forstand), mig i alt fald ikke tilstrækkelig godtgjort, og den er maaske ret tvivlsom.

I det hele taget turde dr. Næsgaard's fremstilling afpsykoanalysen,ligesom de fleste andre, være præget af en vis mangel paa forsigtighed med at drage alt for vidtgaaende slutninger udfra det foreliggende (forøvrigt ofte udmærkede) materiale. Endvidere er det ofte alt for aabenbart, at psykoanalytikerne helst uden videre vil omplante en psykiatrisk (og som saadan ofte frugtbar) metode paa psykologien, uden med tilstrækkelig kritik at foretage de fornødne ændringer i benyttelsen af denne. Thi de problemer, som psykoanalysen beskæftiger sig med, er saa komplicerede og vanskelige, at man vist gør mere skade end gavn ved for hurtigt at ville fremtrylle løsningerne.

Til slut skal jeg bemærke, at de af mig fremdragne punkter af dr. Næsgaard's afhandling udelukkende er saadanne, som jeg har anset for særlig uklare eller af anden grundkritikvækkende.Det forekommer mig imidlertid, at de saaledes fremdragne punkter er saa væsentlige og typiske for psykoanalysen somhelhed,at de af mig fremsatte bemærkninger kan anses for at have adresse til den psykoanalytiske retning i almindelighed.

Tilsolen finnsforeligger et maskinskrevet manuskript på gult og hvidt konceptpapir in folio, mærketmaj 1934-november 1935.Manuskriptet er uordnet. En kronologisk ordning er tilstræbt i denne udgave, men da hovedparten kun er dateretsept. 35, erdigtenei denne gruppe søgt ordnet efter et æstetisk-motivisksynspunkt,hvad der ikke har kunnet hindre en vis vilkårlighed.

Ind imellem de foreliggende hele værker er sat de løse digte, efter et kronologisk princip. Om de i tidsskrift trykte digte vides kun ét sikkert: at de er tidligere end trykket. Hvor der derfor har været tvivl om grupperingen, har motivisk-stilistiske vurderinger været afgørende.

Uden for kronologien er i et tillæg anbragt to ikke-digteriske arbejder, en anmeldelse og et "opråb". Desuden prosafragmentet om Stenka. Man kan diskutere berettigelsen af at medtage dette overhovedet. Begrundelsen er dels, at GM-P selv har ladet etkapiteltrykke (Vild Hvede), dels at det er overordentlig oplysende for de øvrige værker. Tekstgrundlaget er et maskinskrevet manuskript, ombøjet gult konceptpapir, de sidste sider dog håndskrevne.

TEKSTRETTELSER

Retskrivningen er såvidt muligt digterens egen.

I originaludgaverne, undtagennitten digte, har GM-P brugt lille begyndelsesbogstav i alle ord også efter punktum, hvilket ergennemførther,ogsåinitten digte. Det vides ikke, hvad der fik ham til pludselig inden trykningen at lade denne samling sætte med den



daværende almindelige ortografi. Personlig bevarede han sinsædvanligeskrivemåde. Fejl, som skønnes at være trykkeriets, er rettet, ellers er GM-Ps let skiftende ortografi og tegnsætning fulgt, bortset fra enkelte alt for oplagte haste-fejl, især i prosafragmentet. Hvor det drejer sig om vigtigere ting, er det markeret nedenfor.

(Originalens ord er sat efter skarp parentes)

Isolen finnsveksler GM-P temmelig tilfældigt mellem entals- og flertalsformer i verberne efter flertalssubjekter. I denne udgave er dette forhold normaliseret således, at ét af principperne ergennemførtinden for de enkelte digte, hvorved så få ændringer sommuligter foretaget.
