Here we only have a very brief introduction to the regular expression, and a lot of thing hasn't been talked about. But this bit sould prepare you to understand the regular expression you encountered in other places, and when you want to use the regular expression yourself, it will be a good idea to search on the internet and see how other people construct the regular expression and have some inspiration to construct yours."
